For those that donâ€™t know, Neverwinter Nights (or NWN as its often abbreviated) is a computer game made by [Bioware](https://www.bioware.com/). It uses a modified version of the [D&D](https://dnd.wizards.com/) 3rd edition rules, and is set in the [Forgotten Realms world](https://dnd.wizards.com/story/lore/forgotten-realms) setting.

## House on the Hill

At one point a friend and I were making a module for the game, tentatively named House on the Hill, or HotH for short. You can find the work in progress version of it [here](hoth_033.zip).
