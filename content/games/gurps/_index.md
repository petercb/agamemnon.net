Gurps is undoubtedly one of my favourite role playing systems.

I have an extensive collection of 3rd edition books and have been tempted now and then to check out the new 4th edition. Since I haven’t yet though, everything you find here is likely to be for 3rd edition unless specifically labeled otherwise.
