title: Circlet of the Stars
---
AD&D 2nd Edition - Item - Artifact

# CIRCLET OF THE STARS

The Circlet of the Stars was created to enhance the mental and physical powers of the wearer when activated. It appears as a circle of shiny metal that sizes itself to fit the wearers head. The circlet has diamond filled runes on the outside that glow with a light blue colour in the dark. Once put on it can only be removed when the proper command word is spoken. This particular circlet of the stars was created to allow the wearer to control a weapon of the stars. When the two are used together by the same character it is a devastating combination. The circlet is rated as a artifact and the weapon of the stars is rated as a relic.
