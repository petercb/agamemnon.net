**Sword Dancer**

Warrior Kit

> **Description:** The Sword Dancer is a warrior that has concentrated
> all his skills on becoming a supreme swordsman. As a result he is
> deadly when holding a blade but only average with any other type of
> weapons. Sword Dancers scorn armour and shields in battle as a weaker
> mans method for protection. They believe that if one's own skill
> cannot protect him from death then he is better of dead.
>
> Sword Dancers must have minimum scores of 13 in Strength,
> Constitution, and Dexterity, and of 12 in Intelligence. They may be of
> any neutral alignment only.
>
> **Role:** A Sword Dancers role in a campaign is that of a sword for
> hire. He will hire himself out to fight for causes that he believes
> in. Some Sword Dancers choose a cause and dedicate their lives to that
> cause.
>
> **Secondary Skills:** If you're using the Secondary Skills rules, the
> Sword Dancer must take Weaponsmith.
>
> **Weapon Proficiencies:** Bonus Proficiencies: The Sword Dancer
> receives three extra weapon proficiency slots. Unfortunately he is
> told how to spend most of his proficiencies. Required: Two-Weapon
> Style Specialization, Ambidexterity, Broad Weapon Group (Blades), and
> specialize in one blade of his choice. After all this is done he only
> has one slot left which he can spend in any way as long as it does not
> violate his restrictions.
>
> **Nonweapon Proficiencies:** Bonus Proficiency: (General) Dancing.
> Recommended: (Rogue) Juggling, (Warrior) Blind Fighting, (General)
> Riding: Land Based.
>
> **Equipment:** The Sword Dancer must buy the weapon in which he has
> specialized, but except for that limitation may spend his gold
> precisely as he pleases.
>
> **Special Benefits:** When he's wearing no armour he receives a -2
> bonus to his AC; he's so nimble that he's very hard to hit.
>
> At 1st level, he gets a +1 to hit with any one type of sword (his
> choice from among those he has proficiency with). This goes up +1
> every six experience levels (eg. +2 at 7th, +3 at 13th).
>
> At 1st level, he gets a -1 bonus to his AC when holding any type of
> sword he is proficient in while wearing no armour or shield (he gains
> a extra -1 one time bonus to AC if he is using two swords). Every four
> additional experience levels he gains an additional -1 bonus to his
> AC.
>
> When he loses more than 2/3 of his hit points the Sword Dancer will go
> into a controlled battle wrath. When this happens he ignores all other
> situations until he or his enemy is killed. If restrained he will have
> to make an intelligence check -6 to return to normal. While the Sword
> Dancer is in battle wrath he gains the following bonuses: +2 hp, +2 to
> damage, +1 to attack. When he comes out of the rage he loses the extra
> hit points, if this puts him below 0 hp he is dead.
>
> **Special Hindrances:** Cannot wear any type of armour (disdains it as
> something needed only by an inferior swordsman), neither can he use
> any type of shield in combat. Can only be proficient in bladed
> weapons, can only specialize in swords. He can not specialize in the
> Weapon and Shield Style. When there's another swordsman around, intent
> on proving that he's the best in the world, it's the Sword Dancer he
> settles upon and challenges. Archers have a grudge against the Sword
> Dancer and will try to humiliate them at every turn.
>
> **Wealth Options:** The Sword Dancer starts with the normal 5d4ï‚´10 gp
> beginning money.
>
> **Races:** Humans, Half-elves and elves only.
