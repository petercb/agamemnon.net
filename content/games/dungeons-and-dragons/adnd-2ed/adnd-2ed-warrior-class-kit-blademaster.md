# Blademaster

AD&D 2nd Edition - Warrior class kit

## Description

The Blademaster is a warrior that has concentrated
all his skills on becoming a supreme swordsman. As a result he is
deadly when holding a blade but only average with any other type of
weapons. Blademasters are taught to focus their minds so that the
weapon becomes a part of them, their fighting style is one of great
agility almost like a dance. For this reason Blademasters scorn armour
and shields in battle as it hinders them in their movements. Leather
is the heaviest armour they will ever wear. Any heavier armour would
hinder their abilities.

Blademasters must have minimum scores of 13 in Strength, Constitution,
and Dexterity, and of 12 in Intelligence. They may be of any
alignment.

## Role

A Blademasters role in a campaign is that of a sword for
hire. He will hire himself out to fight for causes that he believes
in. Some Blademasters choose a cause and dedicate their lives to that
cause.

## Secondary Skills

If you're using the Secondary Skills rules, the
Blademaster must take Weaponsmith.

After all this is done he only has one slot left which he can spend in any way as long

## Equipment

The Blademaster starts with a fine or higher quality
weapon of his choice (must be one he is specialized in) and may spend
his gold as he pleases.

## Special Benefits

When he's wearing no armour he receives a -2
bonus to his AC; he's so nimble that he's very hard to hit.

At 1st level, he gets a +1 to hit with any one type of sword (his
choice from among those he has proficiency with). This goes up +1
every six experience levels (eg. +2 at 7th, +3 at 13th).

At 1st level, he gets a -1 bonus to his AC when holding any type of
sword he is proficient in (he gains a extra -1 one time bonus to AC if
he is using two swords). Every four additional experience levels he
gains an additional -1 bonus to his AC.

A Blademasters symbol is a Heron-mark, anyone who recognizes a
Blademaster will become wary in any dealings that he has with him.
Blademasters are respected and feared by other swordsmen because of
their superior training and their reputation of being unstoppable.

## Special Hindrances

Cannot wear any type of heavy armour (disdains
even lighter armour; can only wear leather and padded), he will never
use any type of shield in combat. Can only be proficient in bladed
weapons, can only specialize in swords. Will avoid the use of Bows and
Crossbows in combat. Will never use Lances or Polearms, dislikes blunt
weapons and will strive never to use them. He can not specialize in,
or even use, the Weapon and Shield Style. When there's another
swordsman around, intent on proving that he's the best in the world,
it's the Blademaster he will challenge. Swordsmen and guards will
become cautious and tense when a known Blademaster is involved in
their affairs.

## Wealth Options

The Blademaster starts with the normal 2d4x10 gp
beginning money.

## Races

Humans, Half-elves and elves only.
