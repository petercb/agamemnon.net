An original creation by Palladium and one I found had enormous potential to expand on. One of the first things I did was try and come up with a way to get all the cool stuff that was in Robotech, into the Rifts universe. I called my expansion [Siratech Enterprises](rifts/siratech.md), and and although I never completed it you can see the beginnings.
