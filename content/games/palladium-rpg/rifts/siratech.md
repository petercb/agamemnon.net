**SiraTech Enterprises**

*A RIFTS Netbook*

## Introduction

One of my favourite shows of all times was the Robotech cartoon series.
When I discovered that Palladium had a line of Robotech Role-playing
books I immediately ran out and bought them. This was my first
experience with role-playing games. I collected many other RPG's and
miniature games over the years but Palladium was always one of my
favourite game publishers.

One day I was browsing the locale gaming store when I ran across a new
RPG by Palladium called Rifts. I bought it and my friends and I sat down
to try it out. It was an immediate hit. After many years now of playing
many campaigns in the Rifts world I found that the one thing that was
lacking was really cool transformable mecha like those in Robotech. So I
decided to create a sourcebook and story line to bring the vehicles of
Robotech into the Rifts universe. At first I just created characters and
transported them from the Robotech universe into Rifts. But I quickly
discovered that the mechs were severely out gunned. Not only that, but
when you ran out of missiles and other ammunition it was expensive, time
consuming, and in some cases impossible to get replacements.

One day a solution to my problem suddenly hit me. What if a manufacturer
in the Rifts universe somehow acquired the plans and ability to
manufacture the mecha of Robotech? I set out making improved versions of
some select mecha and used them in a test campaign. The idea seemed to
work well, and so was born the SiraTech Enterprises Sourcebook.

The sourcebook is far from complete and it takes time to order my
scrawled notes into proper documents. And time is not something I have a
lot of. To give you some idea of what the final goal is in these web
pages read the **History and Overview** section.

## History and Overview

SiraTech Enterprises was founded by an insignificant race of beings in a
remote corner of the Three Galaxies (see Rifts Dimension Book Two: Phase
World) called the Sira'la. Their only talent was the ability to know the
intimate workings of any type of machine. They also showed an increased
level of productivity when threatened. They were relatively primitive
compared to most civilizations of the Three Galaxies, they were only
just taking there first steps into space. They possessed technology
roughly equal to that of 1970's Earth. They lived on a small planet in a
star system that had only three other planets. All of the planets were
poor in minerals and none of them had any moons. They called their
planet, sun and system Sira.

One day, several decades ago, a representative from Naruni Enterprises
found their home planet by accident when the Rift he was traveling
through became unstable. Suddenly and unexpectedly he found himself on
the uninteresting, peaceful world of Sira. After doing some subtle
intelligence gathering he determined that the inhabitants had little
conception of fighting, let alone war. The agent concluded that he would
not find any demand for weapons so he prepared to depart. As an
afterthought he kidnapped several Sira'la and sedated them, hoping to
sell them as slaves to make some profit for him. Arriving later at a
Splugorth planet he sold the dozen aliens at the slave market.

Several years later he heard a rumour from an associate in the
intelligence division of Naruni Enterprises that sent his thoughts back
to this incident. It seemed that the Spulgorth's allies, the Kittani,
were very excited about this race of beings known as Sira'la that were
gifted with machines. They were offering large sums of money to anyone
who could provide the whereabouts of the Sira civilization. Upon hearing
this and seeing a picture of the aliens the agent was reminded of the
planet he had visited so many years ago. He alerted his employers about
his involvement and volunteered to abduct more Sira'la so that Naruni
could determine what was so special about them. Over the next few years
Naruni Enterprises abducted many of the aliens and found that they had
more than a gift with machines. The Sira'la all possessed psionic powers
that let them link with machines and divine their function and
construction. This allowed them to reproduce any technological device
they examined. The Naruni were thrilled, this meant that they could now
reproduce competitor's products without having to steal the original
plans.

They abducted several thousand Sira'la and set up a top secret research
and production facility in a star system near to Sira. Here they trained
the Sira'la as technicians, engineers and scientists. They proved
extraordinarily adept at all mechanic sciences, including bionics,
computer programming, and others. Unknown to the administrators of the
compound, the Sira'la were using the technology they were learning to
contact their home world and inform them of the situation. Many years
passed with more wonders pouring forth from the facility. Because of
this Naruni Enterprises is now one of the most advanced and successful
arms dealers in all of the Megaverse.

It was not to last however. One day the leaders of Naruni Enterprises
received some upsetting news. The facility's staff and all of its
equipment had vanished.

Believing that the Kittani had found the Sira'la, agents were sent to
recover them. The agents returned to report that the Kittani had
apparently given up their search more than a decade before and were not
responsible for the ransacking of the facility. In fact, the Kittani's
own captive Sira'la had been abducted as well. Close inspection of the
facility revealed that there was a residual spatial anomaly at a point
beyond the gravitational pull of the planet. Naruni assumed that
inter-dimensional raiders had attacked the facility and made off with
its contents. The lack of any significant signs of a struggle caused the
corporate leaders to suspect inside help. They combed through their
ranks looking for moles. Through all of this many years rolled by.
Finally, an underling suggested that they accept their losses and just
build another facility, abduct some more Sira'la, and start over. The
suggestion met with approval and an expedition was sent to Sira.

When the expedition emerged from the Rift they found themselves on a
highly developed world. They were quickly captured by Sira'la soldiers
wielding high-tech laser rifles and wearing M.D.C. body armour.
Bewildered the expedition leaders wondered if they had accidentally
traveled forward in time. They had little time to ponder though, as they
were quickly put aboard a space cruiser and transported to the nearest
Naruni outpost. There they were turned over to their associates with a
message to be delivered to the Naruni Board of Directors as well as the
Kittani. The Sira'la would no longer be treated as slaves or property.

Enraged by the arrogant statements of an upstart race of primitives,
Naruni Enterprises put together a task force and a small fleet of ships.
Upon arriving in the Sira star system they were confronted by a fleet of
over two dozen cruisers and battleships. The Sira fleet sent only one
transmission before opening fire. "We warned you." Only one ship escaped
the battle, and the feeling is that it was allowed to escape to carry
the message to its leaders.

From that day forward the Sira Empire has been enemies of Naruni
Enterprises, the Kittani, and the Splugorth. In recent years they have
decided that the best way to remove their enemies is to attack them both
physically and economically. Thus was born SiraTech Enterprises.
Technologically they are now superior to Naruni Enterprises and the
Kittani. To this day Naruni Enterprises can't understand how the Sira'la
pulled it off.

Their fatal mistake lay in their conception that the Sira'la were, and
would always be, primitive. However with the training received from the
Kittani, and especially Naruni, the Sira'la were now just as
technologically advanced as their masters. Through the use of the
technologies that their masters had taught them, they secretly contacted
their home world. Both groups of captured Sira'la, those with the
Kittani and those with Naruni, transmitted all their teachings to the
scientists of Sira. With the whole population becoming involved in
learning new technology, the Sira'la civilization was practically
reordered overnight. They converted their factories into advanced
mechanized manufacturing plants and began to build ships to terraform
and colonize the other planets in their system.

Even with their astounding progress they were still more than half a
century behind most of the rest of the Three Galaxies and had no hope of
standing up against the Kittani or Naruni Enterprises. This all changed
when a team of Sira'la scientists who were studying Rifts detected what
they thought was some type of machine. It appeared that the object was
trapped between dimensions, outside of space and time. Through some
dimensional anomaly, one of the researchers was able to telemechanically
link to the object. His mind was overloaded by the emanations of an
alien technology. He just barely managed to correct the objects trouble
before he passed out. In a flash of energy, a large space station
blasted through the fabric of space and time to emerge in orbit around
the planet. The Sira'la had just discovered the lost Robotech Factory
Satellite and all the alien technology that it possessed.

The factory was abandoned; the crew had died from the rigours of being
trapped between realities for so long. The Sira'la claimed the factory
for themselves and set about studying it. The alien technology of
protoculture was totally beyond them, but they were able to repair the
factory; much as the inhabitants of Earth in the Robotech dimension had
been able to repair the SDF-1. Using the advanced technology gained from
the Kittani and Naruni the Sira'la were able to convert the factory to
use regular power sources. They were also able to adapt plans found
aboard the factory and create weapons of war that far surpassed those of
Naruni and all other arms dealers. They were even able to adapt the
"Fold Drive" to work without protoculture, allowing them to travel
through space and between dimensions instantly.

Now that they were ready, they planned and executed the release of the
captive Sira'la, thwarted the attempts of Naruni to enslave them again,
and vanquished a small fleet of attacking space craft. Although pleased
with themselves, the Sira'la knew that they would soon be discovered by
the other powers of the Three Galaxies. So they decided to dive into
galactic culture first. They formed SiraTech Enterprises and developed a
line of robots, power armour, vehicles, and weapons to market. They knew
that their material was superior to that of Naruni and most others. The
technology of mass production found in the Robotech Factory Satellite
enabled them to produce their products inexpensively. This gave them an
edge over Naruni Enterprises, who like to charge top dollar for their
hardware.

At present, SiraTech is gaining a reputation for high quality
merchandise and friendly service. In many people's eyes this makes them
preferable to Naruni Enterprises with its strong arm tactics and
under-handed business deals. SiraTech Enterprises keeps the best of its
technology for use by the Imperial Siran Army and their mercenary
company the Aesirian Army. The equipment it does market commercially is
still far superior to that of any other manufacturer in the Three
Galaxies.

The development of SiraTech Enterprises and the Siran Empire can be
viewed chronologically in relation to Rifts Earth time in the
**Timeline** section.

| 103 P.A. | SiraTech includes transformable vehicles into its commercial line. Previously these were restricted to the Aesirian Army and the Imperial Siran Army. The Imperial Siran Army gains new more advanced equipment.                                                                                                    |

## Technology

The technology used by SiraTech Enterprises can best be described as a
combination of Naruni and Kittani basic engineering principles enhanced
by the alien science of Robotechnology.

Although the Sira'la where never able to reproduce the alien power
source known as "protoculture" they were able to simulate its properties
by other means. What they failed to reverse engineer they replaced with
technology learned from the Kittani and Naruni.

While many may say that SiraTech is just a bunch of "copy cats" this is
not entirely true. While it is true that all of their products are based
on designs found in the Robotech Factory Satellite, all of these designs
have been completely re-engineered. Only the outward appearance is the
same, the inner workings are usually completely different, and much more
advanced than the originals.

The reason for this is that though the Sira'la could design a vehicle or
device entirely from the ground up, they prefer the challenge of
improving an existing design. Which to be honest is much more difficult.
It would have been far easier to create a new super advanced aerospace
fighter from the ground up, rather than redesign Robotech's Alpha
fighter to compete in the Three Galaxies, but still retain the
characteristics of the original.

One of the most complicated projects SiraTech ever embarked upon was to
reverse engineer the advanced pilot interface system that Robotechnology
gained through the use of Protoculture. Their first success in this area
was really just an extension of their own psychic powers.

The Telemechanic Vehicle Link was developed to allow the Sira'la to
interface directly with a vehicle using their psionic power of
Telemechanics. Unfortunately it required that the vehicle be designed
with this capability in mind from the beginning.

The Siran scientists thought that a proper system of advanced control
should have the capability to be added to any existing vehicle, and
should be usable by those who do not have a specific psionic power. They
set about creating a Neural Interface that would allow any pilot to
experience intimate control similar to the Telemechanic Link. They
succeeded, but the system required that the pilot have a cybernetic
attachment implanted in their cranium. Work continues to perfect a
system that does not require intrusive surgery.

A spin off of the Neural Interface was the Robotic Interface; it is
basically a version of the system that allows intelligent Bots to
control vehicles more completely. In fact it allowed them to all but
become the vehicle.

SiraTech's main goal is to create vehicles that respond faster and
better to their user's commands. The devices listed above are just one
approach to this problem; another approach resulted in the SiraTech
Reflex Response and Augmentation System. This is one of the crowning
achievements of Siran scientists; it can be added to any vehicle or
incorporated from the design phase. It drastically improves the
performance of a vehicle and is the cornerstone to SiraTech's edge in
the performance market.

With all these wonderful technologies you would think SiraTech would be
satisfied that they could take it easy and ride their current successes.
That is not the case though, ever the perfectionists the Siran
scientists are rumoured to be delving into nano-technology to create
modular vehicles and weapons the likes of which only the most
imaginative have contemplated...

### Neural Interface

This device gives the user a direct link from brain to equipment. It was
developed by SiraTech Enterprises for use by individuals who could not
link to vehicles with Telemechanics. It is most commonly used in
conjunction with a vehicle control system to provide the user with a
much more precise control over the vehicle's movements, and use of
vehicle mounted weapon systems.

**Note:** The term vehicle is used here to represent any and all
conventional vehicles, robot vehicles, jet packs, and power armour.
Basically any equipment used for transport (motorized of course.) This
does not include TW items and equipment of any sort.

The user must have a Neural Interface implant (hereafter referred to as
an NI-jack) and the vehicle must be equipped with Neural Interface
equipment. The NI-jack is a cybernetic device that is hooked directly
into the user’s nervous system and motor control portion of the brain,
allowing direct and complete control over the various functions integral
to the vehicle. The Neural Interface (abbreviated NI here after), is a
special electronic/cybernetic control interface conduit shaped like a
ultra sophisticated audio/visual plug, hooked up to a specialized
vehicle and weapons control computer. The interface cord and jack are
encased in a highly durable metallic sheathing (3 MDC) to help in
surviving collisions and shock damage.

The NI is equipped with a series of micro servos and a miniaturized
short range sensor, which are activated by verbal command from the
pilot, causing the servos and sensor to activate and guide the interface
conduit to the NI-jack. The user must be located in the piloting
compartment of the vehicle when he does the voice activation. This
insures nearly 100% connection probability. This assumes optimal
conditions. The chance of connection is reduced significantly, to about
60%, if the user is moving in an erratic fashion.

The NI-jack allows the user to view all sensors and visual images and
such from cameras and sensors systems. This includes hearing if the
vehicle is equipped with such sensors. The NI-jack is usually installed
in the back of the neck or the temple. If installed at the base of the
neck, it is fairly easy to conceal from viewers.

The NI-jack is a completely different and independent system from the
Universal Headjack & Ear Implant as found in the Rifts Basic book. They
are not compatible in the least. The cost of the NI-jack is 20,000
credits, not including surgery.

The NI, the vehicle portion of the pair, costs 15% of the normal (non-NI
equipped) vehicle cost. So to figure the final cost of the vehicle,
multiply the cost by 1.15. The NI system can contain and process the
vocal patterns and passwords for 5 users. This can be expanded to 30 by
the purchase of a dedicated computer, costing 250,000 credits.

The NI cost can again be increased by an additional 5% if the vehicle
owner wishes to make this system immune to EMP's, by making the NI
**Optical**. However, without this added cost, the NI would fair as well
as any other computer affected by EMP's (which is to say, not well).
With an Optical enhanced NI, the computer would be immune to EMP's
created by nuclear blasts and other weapons.

If a vehicle is to be made without the "manual" controls, this system
(NI) would cost 11% (percent) of the cost of the vehicle in question,
not the normal 15%. Because the NI accesses the combat computer
controlled systems (ie. Weapons, sensors, Motive systems, etc) directly,
manual controls are not/would not be needed. As in a two-seater vehicle
the person using the NI/NI-jack system would control the vehicle, unless
said vehicle was made as a "trainer" so that the other person can ride
"piggy­back", watching what the first person is doing until the second
person wishes to take control.

The benefits given by the use of this specialized electronic/cybernetic
device are listed below:

#### Power Armour Bonuses:

-   +15 % to the appropriate piloting skill.

-   +1 attack/action per melee

-   +2 to Strike in Ranged combat (with integral weapon systems)

-   +2 to Strike in Hand to Hand combat

-   +1 to Pull/Roll with Punch, Fall, or Impact

-   +1 to Parry

-   +2 to Dodge

-   +4 to Dodge while in air (total)

#### Robot Vehicles Bonuses:

-   +10% to appropriate piloting skill

-   +1 attack/action per melee

-   +2 to Strike in Ranged combat (with integral weapon systems)

-   +1 to Strike in Hand to Hand combat (where appropriate)

-   +1 to Pull/Roll with Punch, Fall, or Impact

-   +1 to Parry

-   +1 to Dodge

-   +2 to Dodge while in air (total) if appropriate

When using Telemechanics, these bonuses are not used. Instead use the
bonuses listed for a Telemechanic link. Only one or the other applies.

The Neural Interface is in addition to any other controls said vehicle
has, and as such, the other controls can still be used by anyone without
an NI-jack.

### Robotic Vehicle Interface

This system can be installed in Bot R.C.C. characters; it allows them to
interface directly with the vehicle. This allows them to control the
vehicle more accurately, making them superior pilots. *Cost*:
750,000 credits.

#### Bonuses:

-   +15% to all piloting rolls

-   +1 to strike

-   +1 to parry

-   +1 to dodge

-   Plus, automatically receive the equivalent skill of *robot, power armour and piloting combat: ELITE* with that vehicle!

If the vehicle also has a Neural Interface the bonuses from that also
apply, since the RVI is merely an advanced Bot version of that system.
Some vehicles have anti-intrusion systems (the robot has to save versus
psionics or receive a nasty jolt doing 2D6 M.D. and the link up is
impossible). This module also gives the Bot character the equivalent of
a universal headjack (see Rifts, page 230), and +15% to all their
computer operation, programming and hacking rolls! Furthermore, once a
successful meld is completed (1D6 melee rounds), the character is the
overriding force in control of the vehicle or machine, and cannot be
subverted or control taken away.

### Telemechanic Vehicle Link

All Sira'la are minor psionic's and possess Telemechanics. As a result
they have developed an advanced system that makes their vehicles more
receptive to telemechanic links. All vehicles that they produce are
equipped with this feature, and unlike their other systems cannot be
built into an existing vehicle.

The pilot must pay the normal I.S.P. cost to link to the vehicle but
once he is linked his power will continue at no extra cost to him until
he exits the vehicle or chooses to terminate the connection. By using
telemechanics to bond with a vehicle the pilot gains the following
bonuses.

#### Power Armour:

-   +2 attacks per melee

-   +4 to strike with weapon systems

-   +2 to strike in Hand To Hand combat

-   +3 to roll

-   +3 to parry

-   +3 to dodge on the ground

-   +6 to dodge in the air (total)

-    

#### Robot Vehicles:

-   +2 attacks per melee

-   +2 attacks per melee with weapon systems

-   +4 to strike with weapon systems

-   +2 to strike in Hand To Hand combat

-   +2 to roll

-   +2 to parry

-   +2 to dodge on the ground

-   +4 to dodge in the air (total); if capable

###  SiraTech Reflex Response and Augmentation System

This advanced reflex response and augmentation system is the commercial
version that can be added to any robot vehicle or suit of power armour.
The system can be combined with Neural Interfaces and Telemechanic
Links. It requires extensive replacement of the vehicles circuitry and
takes at least a week to perform. *Cost*: 20% of the vehicles base
cost.

The system combines advanced processors and a high bandwidth neural
receptor to provide the pilot with increased response time. The system
also has a limited expert system that anticipates the possible actions
of the pilot and prepares for them. When combined with a Neural
Interface or Telemechanic Links the pilot can achieve almost perfect
integration with the vehicle.

All commercial SiraTech robot vehicles and power armour have a version
of this system. All SiraTech restricted robot vehicles and power armour
have a more advanced version.

#### Bonuses:

The following bonuses are in addition to normal combat bonuses.

-   +1 on initiative.

-   +1 to parry at levels three, six, ten and fourteen.

-   +1 to roll with impact, punch or fall.

-   +1 to Leap (auto) dodge.

-   +1 additional melee action/attack at levels five and ten.

## Engineering and Design

Nearly all SiraTech powered armour and robot vehicles are copies of
Robotech mecha, at least on the surface. In actual fact though, SiraTech
scientists completely reverse engineered the mecha designs they found
aboard the Robotech Factory Satellite. They then worked in as many
improvements as they could given the constraints of the original design,
and then built the vehicles up using the more advanced technology at
their disposal.

The result is vehicles that look to be exact duplicates of Robotech
mecha, but which are in fact stronger, faster, and much more deadly.

For the most part the RDF era designs have been improved to nearly the
limit of SiraTech's capabilities. These vehicles have been allocated for
commercial sale. Other more modern Robotech designs have been carefully
augmented to their maximum limits while still retaining the features of
the original. These vehicles have been designated as restricted
vehicles, only for use by the Siran Military and the Aesirian Army.

In some cases existing robot and powered armour vehicles found on RIFTS
Earth have been given the same treatment. And in other cases entirely
new vehicles have been designed from the ground up, but which show the
influences of their mixed Robotech/RIFTS heritage. These vehicles also
are restricted for use only by the Siran Military and the Aesirian Army.

Eventually in time these restricted mecha may roll down to the
commercial market as new designs are released that render the old ones
less cutting edge. Anyway you look at it though SiraTech has a product
line that is astoundingly advanced, the only thing holding them back
from total market domination is that they have not yet been able to ramp
supply up to meet demand. If they ever do manage to flood the market
their name will become a known and respected symbol.

Until then their name is only whispered in rumours on the lesser
developed worlds of the Three Galaxies. The sight of one of their
creations is enough to cause crowds to stop and stare... assuming they
aren't looking at the hostile end...

## Commercial Products

SiraTech restricts its more advanced designs for use by the Siran
Imperial Army and to a lesser degree the Aesirian army. For commercial
release they have a line of older designs as well as some newer ones
that were created especially for mass market distribution. Below is a
list of those that are available for sale.

### Power Armour

#### SiraTech Cyclone Power Armour

    The Cyclone is one of SiraTech's greatest commercial successes.
The idea of a small, fast, one man vehicle capable of turning into an
agile suit of power armour captivated many buyers. The cyclone is the
most technologically advanced of any commercial product marketed by
SiraTech. Although the Siran military has replaced it with the more
sophisticated Skyclone, it has just become available commercially.

In order for the cycle to transform, the pilot must be wearing a suit
of ST-4 Riding Armour. If not, the cycle will be unable to initiate
the transformation sequence due to the fact that the body armour is an
integral component of the power armour. The complexity involved in the
transformation of such a small vehicle insures that there will not be
any successful "knock-off" attempts of this popular vehicle.

**Model Type:** ST-BA001-B

**Class:** Strategic Mobile Military Transformable Exo-Skeleton

**Crew:** One.

**M.D.C. by Location in Cycle Mode:**

Headlight (front) — 5

Tires (2) — 2

inches tall by 20 inches wide by 18 inches deep (18x20x18). A
passenger can also ride seated behind the driver. **Maximum cargo
weight limit**, in addition to the rider is 250 lbs (113 kg). Reduce
maximum speed by 20% for every additional 50 lbs (22 kg) and -1 to
dodge. **Note:** The storage boxes and passenger drop off the
motorcycle when it changes into power armor mode.

*Power System*: Nuclear Fusion, average energy life is 5 years.

*Market Cost*: 25 million credits direct from dealer.

**Weapon Systems**

**1. Mini-Missile Launchers (2):** In motorcycle mode, the two
launchers are side by side in the nose of the cycle. In power armor
mode, the launchers are divided, with one on each side of the
chest/shoulder area. Both launchers hold six missiles each.

*Primary Purpose*: Assault

*Secondary Purpose*: Anti-Aircraft

*Missile Type*: Any mini-missile.

*Mega-Damage*: Varies with missile type.

*Range*: Usually about one mile.

*Rate of Fire*: One at a time or in volleys of 2, 4, 6 or 12.

*Payload*: 12 total; 6 per launcher.

**2. Forearm Mini-Missile Launcher (1):** A pair of mini-missile tubes
are located on one of the powered armors forearms, the other has a
pulse laser. It is up to the user which arm the launcher is on. When
in motorcycle mode the launcher is located on the same side of the
front wheel.

*Primary Purpose*: Assault

*Secondary Purpose*: Anti-Aircraft

*Missile Type*: Any mini-missile.

*Mega-Damage*: Varies with missile type.

*Range*: Usually About one mile.

*Rate of Fire*: One at a time or in a volley of 2 (all).

*Payload*: 2 total.

**3. Forearm High Intensity Pulse Laser Gun:** This weapon is mounted
on one of the forearm shields and tied directly to the vehicles power
supply. In motorcycle mode, the weapon can be rotated upward in a 45
degree angle and fired by pressing a trigger in the handle bars.

*Primary Purpose*: Assault

*Mega-Damage*: 3D6+6 M.D. per single shot, or 1D6x10+10 M.D.
triple pulse burst.

*Range*: 2000 feet (610 m).

*Rate of Fire*: Equal to total number of hand to hand attacks per
melee.

*Payload*: Effectively Unlimited.

*Special Bonus*: +2 to strike — thanks to the laser targeting
system.

**4. Optional: HI-S120 Beam Cannon:** A large high-intensity laser
rifle designed for the battle cycle (or any other power armor suit
with a P.S. of 28 or higher) as an additional weapon system. The
weapon is stored on the top right or left side in cycle mode and
carried in power armor mode. It can only be carried in a free hand
(one that does not have a pulse laser gun mounted on it). It can be
used by normal humans like a rifle, but is heavy and awkward, and
imposes a penalty of -3 to strike.

*Range*: 4000 feet (1200 m).

*Mega-Damage*: 5D6+2 M.D. or 2D4x10+16 M.D. multiple pulse burst
(three simultaneous shots; counts as one melee action).

*Rate of Fire*: Standard.

*Payload*: 30 shots per long E-Clip.

*Weight*: 14 lbs (6.4 kg)

**5. Optional: Missile Launcher Sidecar:** The sidecar can be attached
to the battle cycle in motorcycle mode only, or onto any type of
larger, conventional motorcycle. The sidecar will automatically detach
and drop away from the battle cycle when it changes to power armor
mode.

*Primary Purpose*: Assault

*Secondary Purpose*: Anti-Aircraft

*Missile Type*: Any mini-missile.

*Mega-Damage*: varies with missile type.

*Range*: Varies with missile type, usually 1 mile.

*Rate of Fire*: One at a time or in volleys of 3, 6, or 9 (all).

*Payload*: 9 total.

**6. Optional: ST-RL6 Heavy Rocket Cannon:** This weapon is hand held
in soldier mode and top mounted in cycle mode. Only one can be
carried, but can be combined with other weapon systems except CADS.
The rocket cannon can only be held in a hand that has no forearm
weapon system, or forearm mini-missile launcher.

*Primary Purpose*: Assault

*Secondary Purpose*: Anti-Aircraft

*Missile Type*: Any mini-missile.

*Mega-Damage*: varies with missile type.

*Range*: Varies with missile type, usually 1 mile.

*Rate of Fire*: One at a time.

*Payload*: 6 total.

**7. Optional: Close Assault and Defence System (CADS):** This hand to
hand weapon system can be used in place of the other types of forearm
weapons. The Cyclone is fitted with large disc-like forearm shields
that contain the CADS system. With the press of a manual control stud
or by voice activation (a spoken 4 digit code), one or both of the
retractable blades will spring out for instant use. The blades are
double-edged, sword-like weapons with a high-frequency energy field
around them, creating a mega-damage blade weapon.

The blades are powered by the cyclone’s own power supply and cannot be
removed without tools. Detached from the cyclone, a CADS is a
worthless weapon, weighing far to much to wield even as a two-handed
weapon and it is no longer energized.

*Primary Purpose*: Hand to Hand Combat

*Secondary Purpose*: Clandestine operations.

*Mega-Damage*: 1D6x10 M.D.

*M.D.C. Special*: 50 when retracted, but a renewing energy field
provides the blades and forearms with unlimited M.D.C. when extended
(this only protects the blades and forearms).

*Special Bonus*: Adds +2 to parry in hand to hand combat.

**8. Hand to Hand Combat:** Rather than use a weapon, the pilot can
engage in mega-damage hand to hand combat.

*Bonuses & Damage from Battle Cycle Combat Training*

Restrained Punch — 1D4 M.D.

Full Strength Punch — 2D4 M.D.

### Robot Vehicles

-   “Stinger” Combat Robot

-   “Dark Knight” Transformable Hover Tank

-   “Viper” Transformable Robot Jet Fighter

#### SiraTech “Stinger” Combat Robot

This is one of the only vehicles from the early productions of the
Sira'la that is still in service. It has been updated and improved but
the only real change from its first production is the addition of a
multi rifle.

The origins of this mecha can be traced back to the first attempts of
the Sira'la to produce Robotech type vehicles. They were very pleased
with the replicas of VF veritechs that they were producing but less
satisfied with Destroid reproductions. They disliked the lack of
maneuverability that charcaterized Destroids, but they didn't want to
sacrifice the fire-power. Eventually they would adopt the style of
multi-rifle seen on the Silverhawk (see Phase World pg. 130) but in
the meantime they developed a highly maneuverable robot vehicle.

The Stinger was inspired by a report found on the Robotech Factory
satellite about the guerrilla activities by a band of female Zentraedi
on Robotech Earth during the Zentraedi Uprisings. This band had
apparently taken the Zentraedi Female Power Armor and merged it with
Destroid components to create an incredibly maneuverable robot with
massive firepower. The Sira'la decided to take the basic design of the
Zentraedi Female Power Armor and make similar modifications. It took
them several years to perfect, but eventually they were able to
produce a fast, nimble, highly destructive robot vehicle. It had only
two disadvantages: its armament was limited to missiles (although a
very large payload) which meant that it would run out of ammunition
eventually, and it was very large (55 feet tall). This limited its use
to combat in open environments in combination with other support
vehicles.

When the multi-rifle style of gun pod was adopted by the Sira'la, the
Stinger was redesigned to include an ST-E11 which greatly improved its
combat capabilities.

If you want a visual conception of what this robot looks like you'll
have to conjure one up from my following description. This is because
I suck at drawing and no one I know is has the required skill to pull
this off. So imagine what the stinger looks like take the basic
Zentraedi Female Power Armor (Robotech RPG page 92), next replace the
upper arms with ones similar to those of the Vindicator (Sentinels RPG
page 91) and the lower arms with ones similar in appearance to those
of the REF Gladiator (Sentinels RPG page 64), then replace the lower
legs below the knees with ones that look like those of the Vindicator.
We're not done yet, remove the dual autocannons mounted in the chest
and place a missile pod in the chest there on either side of the face
plate, the missile pods should look something like those of the RDF
Gladiator (Robotech RPG page 59). Well that wasn't so tough was it, or
maybe it was. Hey, its the best I can do, if someone would like to
attempt to draw this or any other of my designs go right ahead, I
would greatly appreciate the help.

#### SiraTech "Dark Knight" Hover Tank Transformable Robot Vehicle

The hover tank was SiraTech's first production of a land based
transformable vehicle. The success of it in combat tests proved that
there was a market for it and the soon to be released Cyclone.

Based on plans found aboard the Robotech Factory Satellite of the
Southern Cross's Veritech Hover Tank, it was relatively simple to
adapt to current technological specifications. Several problems
however arose from the fitting of the main cannon. In it's test phase
the cannon put such a heavy demand on the power plant that it kept
burning it out. It was decided to add a capacitor bank between the
cannon and the power supply to regulate the cannons awesome power
demands. The down side to this was that the payload was now limited.
It was felt however that the vehicles other weapon systems would make
up for this weakness.

**Weapon Systems**

**1. Main Cannon:** A rapid-fire particle beam cannon is located in
the left weapon housing shield/arm. Although it cannot rotate or move
right to left, it can move up and down in a 45 degree angle. The main
cannon is only exposed in the Tank mode, but can also be used (one
attack per melee) in soldier mode if extended from the weapon housing
on the left arm.

*Primary Purpose*: Assault/Defense

*Secondary Purpose*: Anti-Aircraft

*Range*: 11,000 feet (about two miles/3.2 km).

*Mega-Damage*: 5D6x10 per each blast.

*Rate of Fire*: In *Tank Mode* it can be fired as many times
equal to the pilot’s combined number of hand to hand attacks per
melee. In *Soldier Mode* only one attack per melee is allowed.

*Payload*: *Conditionally Unlimited*. Fully charged, the cannon
has 30 blasts (45 if antimatter powered). The cannon recharges at a
rate of one energy blast per minute (or one energy blast per melee if
antimatter powered).

**2. Triple-Barreled Railgun:** This is the secondary weapon of the
Hover Tank in Tank mode, it can only be fired in this mode. Its fixed
forward mounting limits the direction of the railgun to straight
ahead. However, the upper torso of the Hover Tank can move in a 45
degree angle to the left and right, as well as up and down. Also, a
quick flick of the booster jets in the feet and the Hover Tank can
turn in any direction, including completely around.

*Primary Purpose*: Assault/Defense

*Secondary Purpose*: Antipersonnel

*Range*: 4000 feet (1200 m).

*Mega-Damage*: 3D4x10 per burst.

*Rate of Fire*: Equal to the total number of hand to hand attacks
per melee of the pilot.

*Payload*: 40 bursts can be fired before reloading is required.
Reloading is automatic, but takes one full melee. All Hover Tank
railguns have enough ammo for 5 reloadings (that’s 200 bursts).

**3. ST-E10 Multi-Rifle:** This three-barrelled rifle is the standard
armament for most SiraTech robots between 19 and 35 feet tall. The
thicker top barrel is a short-range particle beam cannon with
devastating damage, the lower barrel is a heavy variable frequency
HI-Laser cannon, and the stubbier barrel is an automatic gravity
grenade launcher.

*Weight*: 280 lbs (126 kg)

*Primary Purpose*: Anti-armour and anti-ship

*Secondary Purpose*: Anti-personnel

*Mega-Damage*: HI-Laser: 2D6x10 M.D. per blast; particle beam
cannon: 3D6x10 M.D. per blast. At short range, both the laser and
particle beam can attack at the same time, doing a combined damage of
5D6x10 M.D.!!

*Mega-Damage, Grenade Launcher*: Can only fire micro-fusion
grenades: 1D6x10 M.D. to a blast area of 12 feet (3.6 m). A burst of
10 rounds inflicts 5D6x10 M.D. to a blast area of 40 feet (12 m).

*Rate of Fire*: Equal to the number of hand to hand attacks.

*Effective Range*: Laser: 12,000 feet (3,660 m). Particle Beam
Cannon: 3,000 feet (915 m). Grenade Launcher: 1,500 feet (458 m). All
are doubled in space.

#### SiraTech “Commanchero” Attack Helicopter

Through there many experiments with "Fold" technology, SiraTech
discovered Rifts Earth. Seeing the strife and conflict here, and man's
desperate struggle to survive against monstrous invaders, they saw the
perfect opportunity to market a line of high-tech conventional
vehicles at low prices.

The Commanchero is the first in that line, and is being marketed
exclusively on Rifts Earth as part of a test program. If it is
successful more items will be added, although SiraTech is worried
about the possible hostility from natives towards extra-dimensional
arms dealers. They have not advertised their status as such, and so
far no one suspects.

The Commanchero is another plan that the Sira'la found aboard the
Robotech Factory Satellite. They have added their own improvements to
the plan as they always do, but essentially it is the same as the
vehicle of the same name found in the Robotech universe.

### Bots

#### SiraTech Spectre Unmanned Aerospace Fighter

When the Sira'la discovered the plans for the Ghost aboard the
Robotech Factory they were fascinated. An unmanned combat vehicle
controlled by a limited artificial intelligence unit could greatly
augment a fleet's firepower.

## SiraTech Weapons and Equipment

### PERSONAL WEAPONS

#### ST-HEXAP High Explosive Armour Piercing Rounds

SiraTech has developed a high explosive, armour piercing round that
turns normal slug throwers into mega-damage weapons. Attempts to analyse
the bullets has resulted in them going off as soon as the casing is
breached. It is unknown whether this is intentional on the part of
SiraTech in order to keep the nature of their explosives secret, or if
it is merely a normal result of breaching the protective layer around
the explosive compound. Whatever the intention, the bullets using this
explosive are incredibly powerful.

*Damage*: A HEXAP bullet inflicts 1D4 M.D. per individual round!
This means that even single shot pistols can inflict significant
amounts of mega-damage. Automatic weapons can inflict large amounts of
damage on bursts.

*Market Cost*: 4 credits per explosive pistol bullet, 8 credits
for each rifle cartridge, and 12 for each heavy machine-gun round.

#### SiraTech Variable Frequency Lasers

All SiraTech variable frequency laser weapons are capable of using 40
different light frequencies. A built-in computer will diagnose the
target and after two shots will automatically adjust the frequency so
all subsequent shots will inflict full damage. Or the operator can
manually change the frequency with a touch or voice command. Number 7
counters the USA-G10 Glitter Boy, number 26 counters most SiraTech
armour, the other settings are able to overcome other laser resistant
armours.

#### SiraTech Grenades

**Fragmentation:** 4D6 M.D. to a 30 foot (9.1 m) area.

**Light High Explosive:** 6D6 M.D. to 12 foot (3.6 m) area.

**Heavy High Explosive:** 8D6 M.D. to a 12 foot (3.6 m) area.

**Plasma:** 8D6+2 M.D. to a 12 foot (3.6 m) area.

**Micro-Fusion:** 1D6´10 M.D. to a 12 foot (3.6 m) area.

#### ST-ATL10 Anti-Tank Laser Rifle

This is a heavy weapon built to give infantrymen a chance against the
armoured behemoths that dominate the battlefield. The shortcomings of
this weapon are its hideous energy demands and its weight. It’s so heavy
(the barrel is thick with insulation to protect against heat) that it
takes two normal humans to carry it (cyborgs and power armour troopers
can use it as a rifle without trouble). Also, they use up E-clips so
fast that only large organisations or wealthy characters can afford to
equip themselves with it. The weapon has four E-clips, two slotted in
the stock and two in front of the trigger. Each shot uses the entire
energy load from one of the clips!

*Weight*: 30 lbs (13.5 kg).

*Mega-Damage*: 5D4´10+10 M.D. per shot!

*Rate of Fire*: Single shots only; each shot empties an entire
E-clip!

*Effective Range*: 3000 feet (914 m)

*Payload*: 4 shots (1 per E-clip).

*Cost*: 100,000 credits

#### ST-100 “Hawkeye” Defence System

This large, automated sentry weapon is a modified version of the ST-E6
Multi-Rifle with a built-in nuclear reactor and contragravity hover
system. The thicker top barrel is a short-range particle beam cannon
with devastating damage, and the lower barrel is a heavy High Intensity
Variable Frequency Laser Cannon. The “Hawkeye” is used in ambushes, to
set traps, and defend perimeters either as a stand-alone robot sentry or
in conjunction with troops or other defences.

As an automatic defence system, the weapon is programmed to recognise
either specific targets (memory can hold 3000 targets) or to defend an
area from all intruders (kills indiscriminately). It is equipped with
passive nightsight, thermo-imager, motion detection, and a laser
targeting system. A coded radio signal can be used to deactivate the
sentry or a shut off time can be programmed into the system before it is
activated. There is also a fail-safe manual off and on button.

The contragravity hover system gives the sentry the ability to dodge,
seek cover, or a better position. It can move at a maximum speed of 20
mph (32 kph) with an unlimited altitude (it will rarely fly more than a
few feet above the ground).

*Weight*: 180 lbs (81 kg)

*Mega-Damage*: HI-Laser: 2D4´10 M.D. per blast, Particle Beam
Cannon: 2D6´10 M.D. per blast. At short range, both the laser and
particle beam can attack at the same time, doing a combined damage of
3D6´10+20 M.D.!!

*Rate of Fire*: Eight attacks per melee round.

*Effective Range*: Laser: 4,000 feet (1200 m). Particle Beam: 800
feet (244 m). All are doubled in space.

*Payload*: Effectively Unlimited.

*Combat Computer*: Combat data file enables it to relocate to a
better position, hide and take evasive action, and to recognise up to
3000 different targets. It is extremely effective against many
supernatural opponents who are magically invisible, detecting them by
heat signature and motion.

*Combat Bonuses*: +2 to initiative, +2 to automatically dodge, +6
to strike, 8 attacks/actions per melee.

*Market Cost*: Never sold on the open market. Is programmed to
self-destruct if captured.

-   Colours: Light Grey.

#### Personal Force Fields

SiraTech Industries deals in personal force fields, that are virtually
identical to ones sold by Naruni Enterprises (see Phase World page 121).
Unlike suits of armour, force fields are light and non-cumbersome (no
penalty to prowl rolls). The force fields that SiraTech Industries sells
work by reacting to both energy beams and to fasl-moving objects (like
bullets and punches) by absorbing and dispersing the incoming energies.
It is possible for an enemy to move slowly and press a weapon against
the skin of the target without triggering the force field, but this is
easier said than done (such attacks are made at -6 to strike, unless the
target is unable to move away — for example, if he's backed up against a
corner or unconscious). The force field offers no protection against
gases or hostile environments, including intense heat. A field wearer
can drown if submerged in a body of water or burn to death if caught in
the middle of a fire (unless he is wearing additional sealed armour or a
space suit of some sort).

The M.D.C. value of the force field shows how close to overload it is.
If the M.D.C. of the field is depleted, it has overloaded and cannot be
reactivated for 12 hours. As long as the M.D.C. has not been overloaded,
it regenerates lost M.D.C. at the rate of one M.D.C. point per melee
round (4 M.D.C. per minute).

On the other hand, force fields need a source of energy. One E-Clip will
keep force fields active for a period between 12 and 2 hours depending
on the power of the field (see below). Naturally, this means that force
fields cannot be left "on" all the time, but only when battle is
imminent. This is a disadvantage over normal suits of armour.

It is NOT possible to wear armour under a force field, unless the field
generator is built into the armour itself. Fields can be built into any
M.D.C. armour suit or into powered armour at an extra cost (typically
about 50% more than the normal cost for the field system). When
connected to a nuclear reactor, the field can run indefinitely but is
still subject to overload.

Robot models exist, but are a lot more expensive. There are equivalents
of all Force Field Classes and they offer double the M.D. protection,
but they cost 20 times as much as the integral force field models for
powered armour

**ST-F12A Light Force Field**

This is the lightest model available and is worn as two

crossed belts over the person's torso (the belts can be converted into
bandoleers for grenades or E-Clips at no additional cost. Each bandoleer
cam hold 6 grenades or 4 E-Clips). The force field will run for 12 hours
on one E-clip. Activating the field takes one melee action and protects
the wearer immediately after activation.

There is an integral force field (the N-F12B) which can be built into
any suit of M.D.C. armour or powered armour. The powered armour version
uses no E-Clip and taps directly into the nuclear reactor of the suit.
The robot model is twice as powerful, but much more expensive.

-   M.D.C.: 45 (M.D.C. 90 for the Robot Model).

-   Weight: 8 Ibs (3.6 kg).

*Market Cost:* 25,000 credits for the personal field. 35,000

credits for the integral model; this includes installation cost, the
armour must be bought separately. The Robot Model costs

700,000 credits.

**ST-F20 (A or B) Medium Force Field**

As above, but offering greater protection. An E-Clip will

power the force field for 8 hours.

-   M.D.C.: 75 ( 150 for the Robot Model)

-   Weight: 10 Ibs (4.5 kg)

*Market Cost*: 50,000 credits for the personal field (ST-F20A),
65,000 credits for the integral model (ST-F20B). The robot model costs
one million credits.

**ST-F40 Heavy Force Field**

This force field requires a harness system and is slightly heavier than
the ST-F12 or ST-F20. This is the usual limit for infantry force fields.
An E-Clip will power the force field for only 4 hours of continual use.

-   M.D.C.: 110 (220 for the Robot Model)

-   Weight: 15 lbs (6.8 kg)

*Market Cost*: 90,000 credits for a personal field (ST-F40A),
130,000 credits for the integral model (ST-F40B). The Robot model costs
two million credits.

**ST-F50 Super Heavy Force Field**

This is the most powerful force field available. It looks and weighs the
same as the ST-F40 field, but is much more intense.

-   M.D.C.: 160 (320 for Robot Model)

-   Weight: 15 lbs (6.8 kg)

*Market Cost*: 170,000 credits for a personal field (ST-F50A),
280,000 credits for the integral model (ST-F50B). The Robot model costs
five million credits.
