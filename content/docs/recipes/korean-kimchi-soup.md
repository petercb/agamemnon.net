||Kosher salt|
|2 teaspoons| Korean chile paste, also known as kochujang |
|1 |medium zucchini, medium dice|
|1 cup |kimchi, coarsely chopped |
|2 cups |low-sodium beef or chicken broth|
|1 teaspoon |soy sauce|
|1 |(14- to 16-ounce) package silken or soft tofu, drained|
|3 |large eggs (optional)|
|2 |medium scallions, thinly sliced (white and light green parts only)|
||Steamed white or brown rice, for serving|

Game plan: Youâ€™ll need to make white or brown rice before you begin.

## Instructions

1. Heat the oil in a large saucepan with a tightfitting lid over medium heat
until shimmering. Add the onion, season with salt, and cook, stirring
occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes.

2. Add the chile paste, stir to combine, and cook until fragrant, about 1
minute. Add the zucchini, season with salt, and stir to combine. Add the kimchi
and cook, stirring occasionally, until simmering, about 2 minutes. Add the broth
and soy sauce and bring to a boil. Taste and season with salt as needed.

3. Using a large serving spoon, add the tofu by very large spoonfuls, taking
care not to break up the tofu into little bits. Gently press down on the tofu
with the back of the spoon so that the broth is mostly covering it. Simmer until
the tofu is heated through and the flavors have melded, about 3 minutes.

4. Crack the eggs, if using, into the simmering mixture. Cover and simmer until
the whites are set, about 2 minutes. Divide the stew and eggs among 3 bowls,
being careful not to break up the tofu or the egg yolks. Garnish with the
scallions and serve immediately with rice on the side.
