## Description

These items appear to be wrist or arm guards. But when magic is detected on them
they will glow brightly. Each of the bracers have command words that activate
their functions. However these magical items are so powerful that they almost
never do exactly what the user wishes.

## Left Bracer

The left forearm bracer has the following random actions and abilities (roll
1D100 and consult the table below):

| 1D100     | Action                                              |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 01-20     | A small silver shield magically materializes (+4)   |
| 21-40     | A large silver shield magically materializes (+5)   |
| 41-60     | A rope line flings from the bracer.                 |
| 61-80     | A whip extends from the bracer.                     |
| 81-00     | A 14" blade extends from the bracer. (+3 to damage) |

## Right Bracer

The right forearm bracer causes the wearer to be resistant to fire and cold. It
also adds a +1 to initiative, +2 to hit, and a +3 to damage when any type of
handheld weapon is wielded in the right hand. It also adds a +4 to
Rod/Staff/Wand and Spell saving throws. It also acts like a 'Ring of Spell
Storing'. But the spells are never the one's the user wants at the time. Here is
a chart to determine what spell is cast. To determine the level at which the
spell was cast roll 4D6.

| 1D100     | Spell                  |
|-----------|------------------------|
| 01-05     | Magic Missile          |
| 06-15     | Charm Person           |
| 16-23     | Feather Fall           |
| 24-31     | Shocking Grasp         |
| 32-35     | Burning Hands          |
| 36-43     | Fireball               |
| 44-46     | Wall of Force          |
| 47-56     | Detect Magic           |
| 57-61     | Darkness 15' Radius    |
| 62-65     | Lightning Bolt         |
| 66-70     | Levitate               |
| 71-73     | Pyrotechnics           |
| 74-78     | Invisibility           |
| 79-83     | Gust of Wind           |
| 84-88     | Water Breathing        |
| 89-93     | Cone of Cold           |
| 94-96     | Disintegrate           |
| 97-00     | Delayed Blast Fireball |

There is a chance that the bracers will function properly, but it is slim.

**DM's Note**: Roll 1D100 after the player has stated what function he wishes to
use. If the roll is over 75 then the action actually happens properly. If it is
between 50 & 74 then the action only slightly messes up (eg. small shield is
summoned instead of a large one or the magic missile drops short of the target).
If the roll is under 50 then consult the charts and roll for the action.
