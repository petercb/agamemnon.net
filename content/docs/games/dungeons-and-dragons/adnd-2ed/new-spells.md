## Copy Protection

* Type: Alteration, Evocation
* Level: 4
* Author: Dave Rosson
* Range: Touch
* Components: V,S,M
* Duration: Permanent
* Casting Time: 1 Turn
* Area of Effect: 1 Object
* Saving Throw: None

This spell makes a map or work containing writing, be it
book, scroll, etc, immune to the effects of the spell Copy
(Complete Wizard's Handbook) or other spells that can
produce a copy of such a work.  Only a wish can copy such an
item, and the copy will likewise have the protection.  The
spell will not effect magical works or scrolls, though it
will effect spell scrolls and spell books, and is not
bothered by other spells (Sepia Snake Sigil,Explosive Runes,
etc) residing on a work it can effect.  Only writing present
at the time of casting is effected: writing added later can
be copied freely.

While the caster of the copy protection may freely ignore
it, even he can't remove it.  Any attempt to remove the copy
protection with a 3rd or lower level spell will fail.
Successful attempts with stronger magic will destroy the
protection and the work both.

The casting involves the use of a fine platinum stamper
(worth 250+ gp and reusable)to stamp the work to be effected
with a runic 'C', the caster's symbol, and the current year.

Each stamping requires ink containing the ground remains
of a single bookworm.

## Dehydrate Water

* Type: Alteration, Elemental:Water
* Level: 2
* Author: Pat Harrison
* Range: 20 Feet
* Components: V,S,M
* Duration: Special
* Casting Time: 1 round
* Area of Effect: Up to 4 gallons of water/level (MAX:20)
* Saving Throw: Special.

When a mage casts Dehydrate Water (also known among the
Great Kitchen Witches of Piliplok as "Water Bullion") up to
four gallons of water for every experience level of the
caster is "dehydrated", and converted to small (1/2 cubic
inch) objects resembling bullion cubes.  Each gallon forms 1
cube, which is tasteless, rough to the touch, and
transparent.  The cubes may then be stored in a cool, dry
location for as long as five years per experience level of
the caster.  While water may be recovered from cubes older
than that, and it is sufficient for sustaining life, the
flavor becomes stale and it is not suggested for everyday
cooking.

If cast upon water with impurities within, it only effects
the water, leaving the impurities separate and alone.  The
spell will not effect any creature, save those composed
entirely of water, which sustain 1d4 points of damage per
level, up to a maximum of 8d4 points of damage, half if a
save vs spells is made.

In order to convert the cubes back into water, they must
first be placed in a container of sufficient size to hold
the resultant fluid.  A drop of water is then applied to
each cube, which will expand and fill the container within
six seconds.  The container must be one commonly used to
hold liquid, and in no case will the cubes become water
again inside a creature or its mouth.

## Disrupter Bolts

* Type: Alteration
* Level: 6
* Author: Hans Cross
* Range: 6' + 1'/level
* Components: V,S,M
* Duration: Instantaneous
* Casting Time: 8
* Area of Effect: Special
* Save Throw: 1/2

This spell creates bolts of disruptive force causing 1d6
damage for every 2 levels of the caster, plus 1 extra point
for every five levels.

Example: 15th level casts this spell, causes 7d6+3 points of damage.

The caster may form one bolt per 8 levels, each disrupting a 25 x 25 x 25 foot
area.

A successful saving throw cuts damage to 1/2.

Material components are 5 scales from a golden dragon and
10 tail feathers from a roc, crushed and mixed with a vial
of holy/unholy water to form each bolt.  If holy water is
used, undead and creatures from the lower planes take an
additional point of damage per die.

Structural Damage:  18  12  5  2.

2nd Edition AD&D Rules:
> Each bolt is limited to 10 dice of damage.
>
> Structural Damage  2 5 12 18 15.

## Elvar's Catastrophic Collapse

* Type: Alteration
* Level: 9
* Author: Dave Wilson
* Range: Touch
* Components: V,S,M
* Duration: Permanent
* Casting Time: 9
* Area of Effect: 1 Creature
* Saving Throw: Negates

This spell, when properly cast, reduces the skeleton (or
carapace) of the creature to a jellylike substance within
1d4 rounds, causing it to suffocate under its own weight.
Undead and creatures of greater than 10 HD are not affected.
Saving throws are made vs. death magic at -4.

The material components of this spell are a vial of black
dragon spittle and a piece of bone (or chitin) of a creature
of the type to be affected.

## Empathic Touch

* Type: Necromancy
* Level: 3
* Author: Michael Rogers
* Range: 0
* Components: V, S
* Duration: One Touch
* Casting Time: 3
* Area Effect: Caster/Creature
* Saving Throw: None

When the mage next touches a creature (requiring a to hit
if the other is in motion) he looses 1d6 hit points for
every 2 levels(up to a maximum of 6d6 at 12th level), which
have been transferred to the touched being.  The caster
cannot go below 0 HP by this spell, and recipient cannot go
above their hit point maximum.  Hit points lost can be
regained by magical or natural healing, and the spell
dissipates if no one is touched within a turn after casting
it.  Empathic touch is useless on the undead.

## Forceblast

* Type: Evocation
* Level: 2
* Forwarded By: Haakon Steen
* Range: 20 yds
* Components: V,S,M
* Duration: Instantaneous
* Casting Time: 5
* Area of Effect: Half-sphere with 2 yard radius.
* Saving Throw: Special

Casting this spell causes the material component, a glass
orb held in the hand, to take off and whiz towards a surface
pointed at by the wizard. A half-sphere of invisible force
blasts outward from the point of impact, throwing any
creature caught in the area of effect a maximum of 2d12 + 1
yards/level, topping out at 2d12+30 yds at 30th level.  From
this distance, subtract half the number of yards actually
flown.  For every two yards in this final figure damage is
one point, half that if landing on something soft, double if
slamming into something hard before the maximum range
reached.

Any creature making a successful saving throw vs dragon
breath can, if willing, jump a third of their movement rate
in a direction they think will take them outside the sphere,
avoiding the blast if successful.  A successful tumbling or
DEX/2 check will drop damage by 25%(or negate it entirely if
landing on a soft surface).

Beings smaller then man size fly an additional 50%.  A
large size creature is only thrown half distance.  If
larger, a victim is not thrown at all, but suffers 1d8 + 1/3
levels damage instead.

## Land Mines

* Type: Enchantment/Evocation
* Level: 4
* Author: Mark Ross
* Range: 15' + 5'/lvl
* Components: V,S,M
* Duration: 2 hours/lvl
* Casting Time: 1 round
* Area of Effect: 3'x3' square
* Saving Throw: Halves

Upon casting this spell, a mage may mentally select one 3'x3'
surface,per 3 levels, to be effected.  The player should give the
location of each land mine secretly to the DM, and may tell other
characters at the risk of having a nearby enemy overhear them (a
code or signal of some sort is off course feasible).

After the spell is in effect, anything that weighs more than
one pound that steps or is placed in an enchanted area triggers
the effect, an explosion for d12 points of damage that knocks the
offending creature or item back d20 feet.  If the flight is
interrupted by a large solid object, the victim takes points of
damage equal to the number of feet left to go.

The explosion doesn't damage the surface it is placed on, but
will force all things within 10' that are not secured to save vs
paralyzation or fall back 1d3 feet.  It will also set off any
other magic land mines within the 10 feet.

The material component of this spell is a fine glass orb, of
not less than 25 gp in value, which must be shattered on the
ground.

## Razol's Sloshing Shape

* Type: Alteration
* Level: 3
* Author Dave Rosson
* Range: 0
* Components V,S,M
* Casting Time: 2
* Duration 1 Turn/lvl
* Area of Effect: Caster
* Saving Throw None

When this spell is cast, all parts of the wizard will
suddenly soften to a spongelike consistency, causing a
sudden collapse into a heap, accompanied by a sloshing
sound.  Organically based clothing will also so transform,
and adhere to the skin.  The blobular mass of the wizard may
move (accompanied by a sloshing sound) at a rate of 6, has
an AC of 6, cannot make an effective attack or cast a spell,
and takes only 1 point of damage from blunt weapons (half
from piercing, full from slashing).  The mage can move
through cracks as small as 1X10 inches in this form, which
can be abandoned at any time before its duration.  If the
spell ends and no part of the wizard is exposed to an area
where his normal form could fit, he perishes.

The material component is a small (1 inch diameter) sphere
containing a small piece of a deadly pudding.  The sphere
can be made of any material that the type of pudding used
cannot penetrate, and is not consumed (though the contents
are) by the casting of the spell.

## Serpentine Fire

* Type: Conjuration, Elemental:Fire
* Level: 4
* Author Pat Harrison
* Range: 10 Yards
* Components V,S,M
* Duration: 2 Rounds/level
* Casting Time 5
* Area of Effect: 4 sq.ft./lvl
* Saving Throw None

When Casting this spell, the Magic-User tosses a snake
skin preserved in oil into a fire.  This causes 1 flaming
snake per three caster levels to emerge and remain under the
caster's control as long as he concentrates.  Otherwise they
will attack the casters' enemies, though not moving beyond
the area of the spell.

The Snakes attack as 4HD creatures doing 1d4 points of
damage per bite, AND 1d4 points fire damage (save vs. spell
for half).  Combustibles in the area of the bite will ignite
for additional (1d4) fire damage.  They have a movement rate
of 15, AC of 5, 2d8+1 hit points, and may only be hit by
magical weapons (+1 or better).  Cold and water based magics
do double damage, but a simple pail of water will do none,
instead resulting in a 1d6 damage burst of steam to anyone
within five feet.  Spells which use and extinguish the fire
source (I.E.  Pyrotechnics) will extinguish 1d4 snakes per
Spell cast.  Dispel Magic will work as per the spell
description.

The use of a giant snake skin will allow the creation of
giant snakes (one per 6 levels of caster) with doubled HP,
1d8 bite and 1d8 fire damage, and attacks as 6 HD.

## Sonic Cone

* Type: Evocation
* Level: 7
* Author Hans Cross
* Range: 1'/level
* Components V,S,M
* Duration: Instantaneous
* Casting Time 7
* Area of Effect: Special
* Saving Throw 1/2

This spell sends out a cone of ultra-sonic waves with a
20' diameter at its maximum range.  Damage taken is 1d6 per
level.

Saving throw cuts damage to 1/2.  In addition those
within must save again or be deafened for 1d6 rounds.
Silence 15' negates the spell in its area of effect.  Under
water, the cone is twice the size, but damage is at 1/2.

The material component is a small wooden drum.

 Structural damage 18  6  8  4.

## Zero-G

* Type: Alteration
* Level: 6
* Author Todd Simmons
* Range: 10' + 1'/level
* Components V,S,M
* Duration: 1d4 +1/2 round/lvl
* Casting Time 5
* Area of Effect 10' + (1' per 2 lvl) radius sphere
* Saving Throw None

By means of this spell, the caster causes a sphere shaped
area to lack gravity.  Some of the effects of the lack of
weight are as follows:

 1) Gravity being non-existent, objects will not fall, and
if already falling, will not accelerate.  Things moving will
continue to do so in the same direction (including rotation
if any) and with the same speed.  Some deceleration will
occur do to air friction, but unless the object was moving
very slowly to begin with, it will sail out of the area or
collide with something before any noticeable loss of speed.
 2) Without large surface areas to catch air (normally two,
or the likely result will be a good spin), such as provided
by wings or shields, the only way for a creature to move is
by pushing off another object.  The only way an object will
move is if pushed.  When things are pushed, push, or both,
the speed is 10 feet per round for the larger object, 1" per
round for point of strength involved for the smaller object,
or half that if the objects are about equal in size.
 3) Weightless liquids will form into globes unless touching
a surface (like a character), in which case they form a film
around it, drowning something requiring oxygen 1-4 rounds
after they aren't holding their breath.  Fire will form into
a sphere as well.
 4) A wizard may not move or dodge while casting spells,
except movement from pre-existing momentum. Unless held down
in some way, the wizards motions from somatic components
will cause light spin from air friction and spoil the spell.
 5) Contained liquids (such as potions) will tend to cling
to a container and take 1-4 rounds to drink unless the
container can be squeezed.
 6) Spells that MOVE an object BY PHYSICAL FORCE (such as
telekinesis) can move any size weightless object at will.
Other spells treat the object as if it still had weight.
 7) Upon expiration of the spell, gravity resumes, possibly
resulting in certain of that within falling from whatever
height they are at with all the appropriate effects.

The material component for this spell is a feather of a
roc in a closed jar of water.
