Mourn The Terrible was a Drow Elven wizard that lived in the Underdark
city of Menzoberranzan for several hundred years before becoming bored
of his life there. He then disguised himself as a surface Elf and spent
the next hundred years adventuring and studying on the surface. Again he
became bored with his life and decided to explore the cosmos and the
inner and outer planes looking for knowledge. After a hundred years of
this he became bored again. He then settled down for the next few
hundred years to craft items of power on an island on the Planet krynn.

## Sword, Velkyn

This was the first weapon forged and enchanted by
Mourn but, alas it did not work exactly the way he had intended. If
the holder knew the name of the sword he could only control the power
of the sword 50% of the time. If the name is not known or the control
roll fails then roll on the following table to determine the outcome.
Otherwise choose one of the effects. The sword has a +8 to strike and
has the ability to change into any type of sword as long as the user
knows the swords true name.

|1D100|Roll Effect|
|-----|-----------|
|01-10| When the sword is swung it slices clean through whatever it was swung at.|
|11-18| Two Lightning bolts fly from the tip to strike any targets in front of the wielder. Cast as Wand.|
|19-25| A storm cloud appears above the user and rains heavily on him for 1D8 rounds.|
|26-30| Any plants in a 50' radius grow twice as large.|
|31-33| Flower Strike. Flowers grow from the wounded victims wound causing extreme pain and 1D10 extra points of damage.|
|34-36| The target that is touched by the sword is immediately turned to stone.|
|37-46| Sword does an extra 20 points of damage.|
|47-58| No effect acts like a normal magical sword +8.|

|91-95| User is teleported 20' in any direction.|
|96-00| Grants user one wish as per the wish spell.|

Just as he finished this weapon it came to his attention that it did not
work the way he had planned. He at first attributed it to the
distraction of the Gods of Krynn fighting over the planet while he was
working so he began again. This time with a new design.

## Sword, Abbil

This was the second sword created by Mourn, but like
the first it also did not work as it should. It was supposed to be an
improved Vorpal Blade but like the first blade it's affects are only
controllable 50% of the time and only if the name of the sword is
known to the user. If the control roll fails or the user does not know
the blades name then roll on the chart below. Other wise pick an
effect from the chart below. The sword has a +8 to strike and can form
into any type of sword if the name of the sword is known.

|1D100|Roll Effect|
|----|-----------|
|01-10| When the sword is swung it slices clean through whatever it was swung at.|
|11-18| Two Lightning bolts fly from the tip to strike any targets in front of the wielder. Cast as Wand.|
|19-25| Control Weather. A storm cloud appears above the user and rains heavily on him for 1D8 rounds.|
|26-30| Any plants in a 50' radius grow twice as large.|
|31-33| Acts Like a Vorpal Blade +3.|
|34-36| The target that is touched by the sword is immediately turned to stone.|
|37-46| Sword does an extra 20 points of damage.|
|47-58| No effect acts like a normal magical sword +5.|
|59-62| The wielders strength is immediately effected. See the magic user "Strength" spell description.|
|63-65| Faerie Fire covers every target within a 20' radius.|
|66-68| 100 gems impale themselves in the targets head.|
|69-79| Fireball as a wand is shot at the target.|

|91-95| User is teleported 20' in any direction.|
|96-00| Acts like a sword of Sharpness +6.|

After finishing this weapon he again realized that this weapon was not
working as he had planned. Feeling very exasperated he decided that the
Planet Krynn itself was at fault. So he moved to Toril and built himself
a new tower and started again. This time he designed the weapon to be
more flexible and more powerful but with safeguards to make the weapon
more controllable by it's user. He spent 50 years searching for the best
materials with which to craft the weapon.

## Weapon of Adaptability, Brorna

This was the third item of this
type created by Mourn The Terrible but like the first two it also did
not turn out like he planned. It is however slightly more controllable
by the user if the name is known. The user has a 50% ,plus 1% per
Experience level, chance of controlling the weapon. If the control
roll is failed or the weapons name is unknown then roll on the table
below. The weapon can also be changed into any weapon known by the
user and strikes like a +8 weapon.

|1D100|Roll Effect|
|----|-----------|
|01-10| User absorbs double the hit points that were caused much like the wizard spell Vampiric Touch.|
|11-18| Two Lightning bolts fly from the tip to strike any targets in front of the wielder. Cast as Wand.|
|19-25| A meteor swarm spell targeted by the user. Cast as per a wizard of 24th level.|
|26-30| Any plants in a 50' radius catch on fire and burn for 1D20 turns at the end of which they return to normal as if it never happened.|
|31-33| The target convulses on the spot for 1D20 turns.|
|34-36| The target that is touched by the weapon is immediately turned to stone.|
|37-46| Weapon does an extra 20 points of damage.|
|47-58| No effect acts like a normal magical Weapon +8.|
|59-62| The wielders strength is immediately effected. See the magic user "Strength" spell description.|
|63-65| Faerie Fire covers every target within a 20' radius.|
|66-68| 100 gems impale themselves in the targets head.|
|69-79| Fireball as a wand is shot at the target.|
|80-84| The wielder becomes invisible.|
|85-87| User is granted one wish.|
|88-90| Darkness in a 50' radius from the sword appears. Will wear off in 1D20 rounds.|
|91-95| User is teleported 20' in any direction unless destination is specified.|
|96-00| User becomes invulnerable to all attacks except wish spells for the next 1D4 rounds.|

Again Mourn was disheartened by his failure. He pondered long and hard
as to why the items were not working properly. After much contemplation
he decided that his techniques were not correct so he spent the next 20
years learning from every major Enchanter he could find. When he finally
determined that he was ready he started work on a new and improved
weapon. This time he created the weapon from a very rare and magical
element that can only be found in 231st level of the Abyss. He spent 100
years slaving over his work and completely enchanting the weapon with
safeguards and controlling mechanisms.

## Weapon of Adaptability, Velve

Again like the first three weapons
this one did not turn out to Mourn's satisfaction. The weapon is more
controllable than the first two weapons but still is not 100%
controllable. Unless one is very strong. If the items name is known
there is a 50% chance of controlling the item plus a extra plus 5% for
every intelligence point above, but not including, 14. This weapon can
also be changed into any weapon desired by the user and strikes as a
magical +8 weapon. If the control roll is failed or the weapons name
is unknown to the user then roll on the chart below otherwise just
choose an effect.

|1D100|Roll Effect|
|----|-----------|
|01-05| User is protected from Petrification as per the scroll.|
|06-10| User is protected from Plants as per the scroll.|
|11-18| Two Lightning bolts fly from the tip to strike any targets in front of the wielder. Cast as Wand.|
|19-25| User is protected from Acid as per the Scroll.|
|26-30| User is protected from Cold as per the Scroll.|
|31-33| User is protected from Dragon's Breath as per the Scroll.|
|34-36| The target that is touched by the weapon is immediately turned to stone.|
|37-41| Weapon does an extra 20 points of damage.|
|42-46| User is Protected from poison as per the scroll|
|47-58| User is protected from Electricity as per the scroll.|
|59-62| User is protected from Elementals as per the scroll.|
|63-65| User is protected from Fire as per the Scroll.|
|66-68| User is protected from Water as per the scroll.|
|69-79| User is protected from Gas as per the scroll.|

|95|User is immune to electricity for 1D20 rounds.|
|96| User is immune to poison for 1D20 rounds.|
|97-00| User is teleported to a desired location no matter what.|

Again after the creation of this weapon Mourn became seriously
depressed. He could not understand why his magic items were not
functioning properly. He finally decided that it was the nature of the
planets that caused his magic items to fail so he transported his entire
castle into the Phlogiston where it still drifts today. He then began to
design a more controllable Weapon with an intelligence to help control
the weapons affects he spent 100 years isolated working on this master
creation.

## Weapon of Might, Ultrinnan

Again the weapon failed to meet the
desires of Mourn. This Weapon is completely controllable by the user
as long as two things are satisfied: (1) the Personality of the weapon
agrees to give you the affect, you may have to have a battle of wills
to determine who gets to choose, and (2) the intelligence is actually
awake. It has a tendency to get sleepy and zonk off for a few
centuries if not awaken. you cannot awaken the weapon if you do not
know its name. If the intelligence is not awake roll on the random
chart below for the weapons effect. The weapon like the last two can
also be formed into what ever type the user desires but in this case
the intelligence may disagree with you. The sword has the following
statistics:

|||
|---|---|
|Communication| Speech & Telepathy|
|Intelligence| 17|
|Alignment| Chaotic Neutral|
|Ego| 22|

After five separate tries Mourn was getting a little hot under the
collar about not being able to create perfectly controllable artifacts
he got so mad that he tossed all five weapons out the door to drift in
the Phlogiston. He then took up studying wild magic in an attempt to
find a way to make his next creation controllable. After spending 25
years studying wild magic he decided to create another powerful magic
item. This time he decided against swords because they were to common so
he decided to create a improved set of Bracers of Defense. As Mourn was
getting fairly violent in his reactions of late he decided to not only
make the bracers for defense but also for offense. He set about finding
rare materials from all over the galaxy and hidden knowledge to include
into his new artifact.

## Mystic Bracers, Blitz and Aegis

Like all of Mourns items these
did not work as he had wanted them too, but at this point in time this
was not a surprise. These items appear to be wrist or arm guards. But
when magic is detected on them they will glow brightly. Each of the
bracers have a name that activate their functions. However these
magical items are so powerful that they almost never do exactly what
the user wishes. A control roll must be made. Wild Mages have a 50%
chance of controlling the effect while all other classes only have
30%. If the control roll is failed then roll on the following tables
otherwise choose an effect.

### Table 1: Random Actions and Abilities of Left Bracer

|1D100|Action|
|-----|------|
| 01-20 | A small silver shield magically materializes (+4) |
| 21-40 | A large silver shield magically materializes (+5) |
| 41-60 | A rope line flings from the bracer. |
| 61-80 | Repeating Throwing Daggers |
| 81-00 | A 14" blade extends from the bracer. (+3 to damage) |

The right forearm bracer causes the wearer to be resistant to fire and
cold. It also adds a +1 to initiative, +2 to hit, and a +3 to damage
when any type of hand held weapon is wielded in the right hand. It also
adds a +4 to Rod/Staff/Wand and Spell saving throws.

It also acts like a 'Ring of Spell Storing'. But the spells are never
the one's the user wants at the time. Here is a chart to determine what
spell is cast.

### Table 2: Spells

There is a chance that the bracers will function properly, but it is slim.

DM's Note: Roll 1D100 after the player has stated what function he wishes to
use. If the control roll succeeds the action actually happens properly. If it is
between doesn't then roll randomly on the chart.

All spells are cast at 20th level ability.

| 1D100 | Spell |
| ----- | ----- |
| 01-05 | Magic Missile |
| 06-15 | Charm Person |
| 16-23 | Feather Fall |
| 24-31 | Shocking Grasp |
| 32-35 | Burning Hands |
| 36-43 | Fireball |
| 44-46 | Wall of Force |
| 47-56 | Detect Magic |
| 57-61 | Darkness 15' Radius |
| 62-65 | Lightning Bolt |
| 66-70 | Levitate |
| 71-73 | Pyrotechnics |
| 74-80 | Invisibility |
| 81-85 | Gust of Wind |
| 86-92 | Water Breathing |
| 93-95 | Cone of Cold |
| 96-97 | Wish |
| 98-00 | Disintegrate |

## Mystic Bracers, Z'ress and Sargh

These bracers are like all Mourn's
items, unpredictable at best. They appear to be wrist or arm guards made
out of a bright alien metal. When detect magic is cast on them they
radiate strong magic. You must know the name of each bracer in order to
activate them. Even then a control roll must be made in order to control
the outcome. Wild mages have a 50% plus 1% per level chance of
controlling the outcome, all other classes have a 30% chance.

The left bracer has the following abilities:

1) store and retrieve weapons as a bracelet of readiness
2) store three types of shields, and
3) fire magical +1 darts that disappear after 4 rounds.

The right bracer can cast several spell at 20th level but control is
limited. If the control roll fails then roll randomly on the following
table for the effect otherwise just pick one.

|1D100|Spell Effect|
|-----|------------|
|01-05| Magic Missile|
|06-15| Charm Monster|
|16-23| Fly|
|24-31| Delayed Blast Fireball|
|32-35| Lightning Bolt|
|36-43| Fireball|
|44-46| Chain Lightning|
|47-56| Detect Magic|
|57-61| Feather Fall|
|62-65| Black Blade of Disaster|
|66-70| Invisibility|
|71-73| Teleport without Error|
|74-80| Teleport|
|81-85| Water Breathing|
|86-92| Cone of Cold|
|93-95| Create Portal|
|96-97| Power Word, Kill|
|98-00| Disintegrate|

If both bracers are worn together the following abilities are also conferred:

1) raises wearers strength to 25,
2) lowers armour class to zero, and
3) gives +1 to initiative.

## Mystic Bracers, Dracoth and Faer

These were Mourns Third attempt at
creating improved bracers for battle but like the others they still
don't work right. Wild mages have a 40% plus 1% per level chance of
controlling them all others have a 20% chance. If the control roll is
failed roll on the proper table to find out the effect otherwise just
choose one. All spell effects are at 22nd level.

The left bracer has the following powers:

1) confers an armour class of zero,
2) can be used to cast various transportation spells, and
3) detects magic same as wizard spell.

|1D100| Random Transportation|
|-----|----------------------|
|01-20| Teleport|
|21-40| Teleport without Error|
|41-60| Dimension Door|
|61-80| Phase Door|
|81-00| Gate|

The right bracer has several powerful attack spells stored in it. If the
control roll is failed roll randomly on the following chart for the
effect.

|1D100|Spell|
|-----|-----|
|01-05| Melf's Acid Arrow|
|06-15| Magic Missile|

|86-92| Cone of Cold|
|93-95| Disintegrate|
|96-97| Power Word, Kill|
|98-00| Bigby's Crushing Hand|

## Mystic Bracers, Elgg and Kyorl

When Mourn enchanted these bracers
he was trying for maximum power, unfortunately he surged his enchant
Item spell so every spell that is launched from these bracers is a wild
surge. However he did improve the controllability. A wild mage has a
control roll of 50% plus 2% per level and all others have 30% plus 2%
per level to control the outcome. however all spells must roll on the
wild surge table. Both bracers also confer an armour class of zero to
the wearer. All spells are cast at the level of 24.
