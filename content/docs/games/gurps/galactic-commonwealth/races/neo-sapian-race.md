## Neo-Sapien Race

The Neo-Sapien race was genetically created by the self-proclaimed
Emperor and his scientists. Their purpose were to serve as highly
specialized troops for the Emperor's goal of total domination. The
Neo-Sapiens are grown in cloning vats and emerge with fully developed
personalities and almost all the skills they will need to know. All
Neo-Sapiens begin their aging rolls at 27½ and frequency increases at
ages 32½ and 37½. There are several different types Neo-Sapiens each
with a specialized purpose. The different types of Neo-Sapiens mature at
varying rates, see individual descriptions for more detail.

### Neo-Warrior - 75 Points

The Neo-Warriors are the back-bone of the Empires fighting forces, they
are merciless, brutal, sadistic killers that the Emperor turns loose on
his enemies. After only 25 days the Neo- Warriors reach maturity and are
ready to go into battle, during this time they also receive additional
training. Neo-Warriors have double strength (but not fatigue), and can
run twice as fast on flat level ground as long as they are travelling in
a relatively straight line.

### Neo-Maga - 60 Points

The Neo-Maga's are the technicians of the Empires war machine, they
operate and maintain the giant star cruisers and destroyers. They also
serve as doctors, administrators, lab technicians, and interrogators.
They have a reputation for being just as sadistic as their warrior
brothers but with more brains and creativity, a very bad combination.

additional training and practise as well as specialized training if they
are designated for special service. Though they are not as physically
impressive as the Neo-Warriors, the Neo-Magas also have double strength
(but not fatigue). Their abilities are more mentally oriented, they have
exceptional intelligence and memory. Neo-Magas tend to be slightly
shorter than the average human, although they are usually stronger and
slightly more agile. All Neo-Magas are albino's, this is a flaw in their
DNA code that the Empires scientists have been unable to fix.
