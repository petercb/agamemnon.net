## Government

The Galaxy is ruled by the **Blood** **Royal**, a group of genetically
engineered humans created by man during the second dark ages to rule
mankind and guide them to their destiny among the stars. The head of all
authority is the ***High King*** who is advised by the council of
***High Lords***.

The basic type of political structure is based on the feudal system and the
theory of benevolent monarchy. Individual planets, outposts and solar systems
are ruled by ***Dukes***, ***Earls***, ***Barons*** and ***Lords***.

Groups of Solar Systems are ruled by ***Kings***, and whole sectors of the
galaxy are ruled by the ***High Lords***.

All owe fealty to the ***High King***, who rules from the planet
**Minas Taras**, located near the centre of the galaxy.
