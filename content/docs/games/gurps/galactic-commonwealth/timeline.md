fortress factories. The areas outside the Mega-Corps become no-mans lands.

## 2051-2079

Mega-Corps create their own private cyber-armies to do battle on rival
Corps. Anyone caught in the middle is indiscriminately exterminated.

successful.

## 2080-2095

 (TL9) Realizing that an escape from Earth and its surrounding
planets and outposts is impossible, a large group of unemployed people
start their own movement. With the help of hundreds of disillusioned
Corp scientists they propose a plan to create a sub-race of superior
human beings to rule over mankind fairly and well.

## 2096-2098

 The first batch of The Blood Royal are created, several
hundred strong they seek to take the reins of power away from the
Mega-Corps. All out war ensues.

## 2099-2103

 The Mega-Corps attempt to create several hundred of their own
"Blood Royal", however it backfires drastically, sabotage by royalist
sympathizers inside the Corps causes the project to go drastically
wrong, for the Corps! Several hundred Haruchai are created, like the
Blood Royal they do not turn out as expected. Seeing the nobility of the
Blood Royal, and recognizing a common origin with them, the Haruchai
pronounce themselves the Bloodguard. Fighting together the Blood Royal,
Bloodguard, and Royalists crush the Mega-Corps and bring peace to the
Solar System.

## 2104-2204

 The Terran Monarchy, headed by the Blood Royal, rises from the
ashes of the Second Dark-Ages. They marshal the resources of the Solar
System to colonize the stars. The first successful STL colonization
attempts take root in Alpha Centauri and Barnard star systems.

## 2225-2304

 The Great expansion continues, the human race encounters
several other alien races, including the Gormelites, Sparrials,
Pachekki, Treefolk, Purulu, and the Truul. All of these encounters ended
in peaceful alliances, except for the Truul who immediately pledged
eternal bondage to the Blood Royal on sight of the High King. General
Tech Level Increases to 11. Discovery of Slow FTL radio and the
Hyperdrive drastically revolutionised space travel and politics.

## 2305-2351

 The Verm Invasion. The allied races suddenly find themselves
under attack from an alien race known identified as Verms. Only the
Blood Royal, with their Psionic Powers and formidable Bloodguard allies
are able to resist a Verm takeover. After defeating the Verms on all
their colonies the Terran Commonwealth constructs the biggest fleet ever
seen in the local star groups. Over the next 20 years they seek to free
the local races from Verm infestation. Once freed the local allied races
are left in a hopeless situation, their populations have been decimated
and their cities ravaged. Because of the Blood Royal the Terran
Commonwealth are the only ones who escaped relatively unscathed. Because
of this, and the fact that the Terrans came to their aid, the local star
groups immediately pledge allegiance to the High King. The Stellar
Commonwealth is formed.

## 2352-2361

 A period of prosperity is enjoyed by all races of the Stellar
Commonwealth. New colonization is curbed in favour of rebuilding after
the Verm infestation.

but the Kaa and their Kronin allies are to powerful, the Commonwealth
slowly loses ground.

## 2388-2396

allies of the Kaa, but rather mercenary legions. A group of Blood Royal
accompanied by a brigade of Bloodguard journey to the Kronin homeworld.
The Kronin are impressed by the Psionic powers of the Blood Royal and
feel a kinship towards the ideals and honour code of the Bloodguard.
After a few duels between Bloodguard and Kronin (in which the Bloodguard
usually won), as well as the deposit of a large sum of galactic credits
into the Kronin bank accounts, the Kronin refuse to renew their contract
with the Kaa. Instead they sign a contract with the Stellar
Commonwealth.

 With the help of the Kronin Mercenary companies the Kaa are
defeated. The Kaa rulers and military however escape to the far corners
of the galaxy. General Tech Level is increased to 12. Fast FTL radio is

because of their high birthrate humankind dominates the colonies. During
this time some new races are encountered. The Member and Saret, a
symbiotic pair of races, are freed from the slavery of the Kaa. Because
of this several minor battles are fought against the Kaa during this
time. The Kaa also repeatedly attempt to assassinate the Blood Royal.
The Member and Saret, lacking any form of government in the wake of being
freed from Kaa oppression, pledge themselves to the High King and become
part of the Stellar Commonwealth. The Blood Royal also encounter the
race known as Tamile, who are impressed by the artistic tastes of the
Royalty. The Tamile join the Stellar Commonwealth and pledge themselves
to creating wonderful art for the High King and the Blood Royal. During
this time the Banduch, Liook Sujan, Gerodians, Fasanni, Cidi, Jaril,
Irari, AnÂ Phar, and Mmm were also encountered, after some negotiations

change its name to the Galactic Commonwealth.

Commonwealth.
