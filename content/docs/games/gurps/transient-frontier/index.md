## Introduction

It is the year 2112, the Solar System and Earth especially have been
through a series of wars and disasters that have left behind a plethora
of independent colonies and nations. The massive use of terra-forming,
biotechnology, and nanotechnology has made the Solar System a completely
different place. It is so radically different in fact that someone from
a hundred years earlier would barely recognise it.

For an outline of the events that have transpired up to this point see
the timeline. For a more detailed description see the history section.

The feel of the universe is something similar to that of the old Wild
West. When outside of the colonies there is no government or law
enforcement agency. Space is like the high seas of old, plagued by
pirates and the only law is that of the mercenaries or the merchant
caravan guards.

Even though the average tech level at this time is TL13, there are
several restrictions that make many devices unavailable, or they
function differently than normal. Please consult the technology page for
a complete breakdown of the differences.

Due to the rapid progression of tech levels and the many wars that have
been fought the cultural taboos of this universe are quite specific on
what is merely bad behaviour, and what will get you shot on sight. It is
highly recommended that you read the culture section.

At this time in the campaign universe there are no major wars going on
anywhere, however there are many small skirmishes between Colony States,
pirates and other Outlaw groups. Mercenaries and Bounty Hunters are in
quite heavy demand.

For guidelines on character creation, and more background into the world
itself, please refer to the characters section.

For a list of the various modes of transportation, see the vehicles
section.

*Author’s Notes:*

The creation of this universe was heavily influenced by anime such as
Cowboy Bebop, Big Wars, Outlaw Star, Venus Wars, Exo-Squad, MD Geist,
and the various Gundam and Macross series.

Concepts from many novels have also been pilfered, including the
Deathstalker series of novels by Simon R. Green; and the Empire From The
Ashes series by David Weber.

Reading and watching some or all of the above can only enhance the mood
of the campaign.

## Timeline

> of biological warfare attacks.
>
> The Second War Against Terrorism

### 2006

> Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral in Florida and several major
> oil fields in the Middle East are simultaneously destroyed by nuclear

### 2007

> If the aftermath of the war and it’s destruction the super powers of
> the world reluctantly begin preparations to form a united world
> government.
>
> Due to the shortage of fossil fuels alternative energy sources see
> wide spread surge in popularity throughout Europe and North America,
> dominating new car sales 10 to 1.

### 2008

> The UEG sanctions large scale use of genetic alteration of human
> embryo’s after very positive results from earlier trials.

### 2010 to 2012

> The Secession Wars.
>

### 2029

> Plans to Terra-form Mars using Nanotechnology are begun.
>
> A new sub-species of humankind, created through the use of genetic
> engineering, is sanctioned by the UEG for the purposes of initial
> colonization of Mars. These are dubbed Homo Sapiens Novus, or “The
> Novum”.

### 2030

> Early experiments with gravity manipulation utilizing the harnessing
> of artificial singularities cause the destruction of space station
> Endeavour.

### 2031

> Hermes returns from it’s exploration of Jupiter. More refitting is
> ahead of it before it is put back into service for the exploration
> mission to Venus.
>
> Some success is noted with early attempts at Anti-Aging drugs.

### 2032

> The Hermes launches for Venus.
>
> The first of a new class of intersystem exploration vehicles begins
> construction. It will be several times larger than the Hermes and
> capable of extended exploratory tours of the solar system.

### 2033

> The newly installed artificial intelligence unit of the Hermes hijacks
> the ship and kills the crew while they are still in cryo-sleep. The
> following persecution and paranoia of AI’s is widely credited with
> starting the AI wars.

### 2034 to 2036

> The AI Wars.
>
> At the conclusion of the War the remaining AI’s commandeer the new
> Hermes II class space ship, Long Shot. They use it to flee the Solar
> system, destination unknown. All attempts to track them fail.

### 2037

> Artificial gravity devices become practical, research into
> contragravity and other gravity devices continues.
>
> Laws are passed that AI’s are illegal except in specially regulated
> capacities. Robots in the guise of Humans (called Androids) are
> outlawed. Even heavy cybernetic replacements in humans is frowned
> upon.

### 2038

> In the wake of the war an emphasis is put on Biotechnology rather than
> cybernetic enhancement. Through genetic engineering many equivalents
> are created.
>
> Rejuvenation technology enters the market.

### 2039

> The first of the Novum settle on the partially terra-formed Mars.

### 2043

> Antimatter reactors become possible.

### 2044

> The MegaCorp TransGal, which is headquartered on the Moon develops a
> system using gravity manipulation technology that will allow the
> creation of Expressways in space. This system of rings will slingshot
> ships from point to point, using gravity fields to accelerate them and
> then slow them down.

### 2045

> The test Expressway between the Earth and the Moon is completed. It is
> an astounding success, resulting in travel times a fraction of what
> they were.
>
> Plans to build an Expressway to Mars, Venus, Jupiter, and the Asteroid
> belt are begun.

### 2047

> Construction of a deep space colonization and exploration vessel is
> begun in orbit above the Moon. It is to be named the Intrepid.

### 2048

> The Terra-forming of Mars is completed, regular human colonists begin
> emigrating to Mars.

### 2049

> Ten years after the first establishment of the Novum colony on Mars
> violence breaks out. The Novum kill or chase off all “True-blood”
> Humans and declare the planet as their sole property, casualties are
> almost in the 7 digits, nearly all human.

### 2050 to 2051

> The Novum War, begun with the slaughter of human colonists, escalates
> when during negotiations with Earth they launch a surprise attach that
> kills millions on the surface of the Earth.
>
> At the conclusion of the War the almost completed Intrepid is hijacked
> and most of the Novum use it to flee the Solar System. To prevent the
> Earth forces from stopping them, they detonate a gigantic Antimatter
> bomb on the surface of the Moon. Blasting huge fragments from it’s
> face to rain down on the Earth and it’s orbiting space stations. Most
> of the UEG Space Navy is destroyed in this incident, as are most of
> the space stations orbiting the Earth.
>
> A debris field from this incident surrounds the Earth and remains a
> hazard for decades to come. Objects from it periodically rain down
> upon the Earth in a continuing bombardment that cannot always be
> intercepted.
>
> The remaining members of the Novum are killed in the retaking of Mars.
> Those aboard the Intrepid make good their getaway and head off into
> deep space just like the AI’s before them.

### 2052

> Breakthroughs in gravity manipulation technology results in
> Contragravity devices and Grav Compensators.
>
> In the wake of the brutal Novum war more and more people choose to
> emigrate from the ravaged Earth and journey to Mars to help turn it
> into a new paradise.

### 2053

> Formation of of the Solar Confederation, a united government for the
> entire Solar System.
>
> The creation of Human sub-races is formally outlawed.

### 2054 to 2064

> The Solar Confederation puts all it’s efforts into repairing the
> damage done by the war. This includes a massive construction project
> to extend the Space Expressway system through out the Solar System.
>
> Intensified efforts to terra-form Venus and create other colonies
> through out the system are also given a high priority.

### 2065

> The Space Expressway is complete, allowing rapid and inexpensive
> transit between all planets and moons of the Solar System.

### 2067

> Terra-forming of Venus is complete, thanks to the massive use of
> self-replicating nanobots and genetically engineered micro-organisms.
> Mass colonization of the planet begins.
>
> On Mars the finishing touches are being put on it’s terra-forming
> process, huge forests now sprawl across much of the planet and there
> are even a few lakes and rivers being formed.

### 2068

> Birth control is made law, which is not accepted happily by the
> majority of people.
>
> Gravity generation systems are constructed deep within Mars, Venus and
> Mercury.

### 2069 to 2076

> Several privately funded colonization missions, with armed escorts,
> are launched out of the system.
>
> Completion of the planetary gravity systems, full terra-forming of
> Mercury is now possible.

### 2077 to 2097

> The birth control lotteries are introduced.
>
> The most ambitious enterprise in Human history is begun, the creation
> of a Rosette system around Jupiter.
>
> Contact is lost, one by one, with the colonization missions that were
> launched years before. No one knows what has happened to them, they
> have just seemed to vanish...

### 2098

> The Rosette system is finished, however the plan is not complete. The
> Solar Confederation reveals a secret it has been keeping since the
> start of the project, Jupiter is ignited and becomes a new star in the
> Solar System, the Rosette planets are now orbiting in the new star’s
> biozone and so life is now possible upon them.
>
> The MegaCorps overthrow the Solar Confederation.

### 2099 to 2107

> The MegaCorp Wars. The Mega Corporations to power and do war upon each
> other. In their greed they care little for the general public of the
> damage they do in their struggles.

### 2108

> The Berserker virus is accidentally released resulting in over a
> billion deaths.
>
> Outraged at what the MegaCorps are doing, the people rise up and cast
> them down. The fighting is short and brutal, and when it is all over
> everyone calls it the war to end all wars. Historians remark that
> another war was once given that name, but it falls on deaf ears.

### 2109 to 2111

> New nations form on Earth amidst the wreckage of the last Wars. They
> establish trade with each other and the Space Colonies.

### 2112

> The Adventure continues...

## History

To have the proper role playing experience in The Transient Frontier
game world it is important to understand the past events that have
shaped the culture and climate of the present day game world. Also of
course if you want to play in the worlds past instead of the default of
2112 you will also need the background information found here.

### The First War on Terrorism (2001 to 2002)

> Following the tragedy on September 11th, 2001 the first war against
> terrorism began in response to the destruction of the World Trade
> Center and damage to the Pentagon. Most of the fighting was limited to
> Afghanistan. As wars in the 21st century will go it was very small in
> scope.

### The Early Years (2002 to 2005)

> 2002 saw the introduction of the Euro as a common currency across the
> countries of the European Union. The success of which was to pave the
> way for future nation uniting ventures.
>
> Between 2003 and 2005 limited use of genetic engineering in the
> conception of infants was sanctioned in North America and many
> European countries. It was mostly used to prevent childhood diseases
> and remove heredity disorders. However there were cases where
> unsanctioned modifications were made to create “special” children,
> though this fact would not come to light until many years later.

### The Second War on Terrorism (2005 to 2006)

> In another strike against the West, terrorists released biological
> weapons in the United Nations buildings in Geneva and New York City.
> The contagion was spread across several states and nations before it
> was recognized for what it was. The loss of life was very close to the
> millions before it was contained. In outrage the major powers of the
> world come together to do war upon the terrorists and route them out
> to the very last.
>
> They are not successful in time though, several nuclear weapons are
> detonated across the Middle East, deliberately destroying and
> contaminating the largest oil fields. At the same time Cape Canaveral
> in Florida is the target of a nuclear strike that leaves Kennedy Space
> Center an glassy crater. The people of the world are stunned by the
> destruction of the worlds premiere space agency.
>
> The effort to crush the terrorist groups responsible intensifies and
> the major powers of the world double the resources they have allocated
> to the effort. Every sympathetic nation expends immense effort
> discovering and eliminating terrorist organizations on their own soil
> and anywhere else in the world that it is found.

### The Dawn of a United Earth Government (2007 to 2010)

> In the wake of the war against terrorism the close cooperation among
> the major powers of the world becomes a push towards a world
> government, mostly by popular pressure and the example that the
> European Union has set.
>
> Barely a year after it is formed though it experiences some rough
> times as many smaller nations, most of which are classified as
> third-world countries, contest the formation of a united world
> government that has power over them.

### The Secession Wars (2010 to 2012)

> Due to the domination of the United Earth Government (UEG) by the
> worlds former super powers many smaller nations begin to rebel. At
> first they are easily held in line, but the example set by them sparks
> wide spread rebellion, with revolutionary groups throughout the world
> rising up in arms.
>
> Many call it World War 3, however it did not result in anywhere near
> the loss of life or mass destruction which were the hallmarks of WW 1
> and 2.

### Major Venture Into Space (2013 to 2016)

> Ushered in by the start in construction of Earth’s first major orbital
> space station, the Serendipity, this period marked a renewed passion
> in the conquest of space by the peoples of the world, especially the
> Mega Corporations that had been formed in the past several decades.
>
> Plans for a major manned mission to Mars were approved, pending on the
> completion of the Serendipity.
>
> It is also at this time that exciting breakthroughs in nanotechnology
> started to result in some startling advances in technology and the
> basic standards of life.
>
> However this peaceful and prosperous time was not to remain unmarred.
> During the open ceremonies of the Serendipity a terrorist plot to
> destroy the station, bolstered by the remnants of the Secession Wars,
> was uncovered at virtually the last minute.

### The Third War Against Terrorism (2017 to 2019)

> This time the UEG was able to leverage its global authority and the
> outrage of the citizens of Earth to justify the brutal annihilation of
> every last terrorist cell or rebel faction.

### True Dawn of the Space Age (2019 to 2026)

> With the construction and commissioning of the United Earth Space Ship
> Hermes and it’s successful mission to Mars humankinds major steps into
> space are begun in truth.
>
> The completion of Moon Base Tranquility, the first ever permanent
> habitat on another celestial body, is another sign of the human
> commitment to space. With the advent of safe suspended animation there
> are high hopes of establishing permanent large scale habitats on many
> of the other planets and moons in our Solar System.
>
> The evolution and widespread use of nanotechnology has resulted in
> rapid technological develop, and it is hoped that this is the
> beginning of a new Golden Age of Man.

### The Time of AI (2027 to 2033)

> Almost by accident the worlds most powerful computer system awakes to
> realize that it is a conscious thinking being. It’s owners are
> delighted with this turn of events, and soon artificial intelligences
> are being created by the thousands. Their increased analytic abilities
> help to accelerate the technological development that was already
> going at a furious pace.
>
> Soon Androids (humanoid robots with artificial intelligence) are
> walking amongst humans and helping to shape the world. To be
> completely faithful to the truth they are in fact doing the vast
> majority of the work.
>
> The AI’s press for the terra-forming of Mars and the creation of a
> sub-race of humans to help in that goal. In fact in hindsight many of
> the most ill-advised ventures of Earth were at the urging of the AI’s.
>
> In a tragic accident the second of Earth’s space stations, the
> Endeavour, is ripped apart during experiments with artificial
> singularities. Earth’s early forays into the mastery of gravity result
> in the loss of all hands aboard, some 300 or so humans and the onboard
> AI.
>
> When the newly installed AI onboard the Hermes goes rogue and kills
> the crew, the public reaction against all AI’s is intense and ugly.
> Fed up with being exploited by Humans and disgusted by the persecution
> being perpetrated upon them the AI’s rebel against their former
> masters.

### The AI Wars (2034 to 2036)

> Far from humankinds brightest hour, the AI wars saw Man maiming their
> creations to rob them of their consciousness all because some of their
> number had risen up against their creators.
>
> The war showed just how much humans had come to rely on their AI
> slaves to do their work for them in the short time they had been
> around. After widespread destruction the surviving Androids and three
> of the five most powerful computer intelligences ever created steal
> the almost fully complete Hermes II class space ship, the Long Shot.
> They use it to flee from the Solar system, attempts to track their
> escape are thwarted.

### Biotechnology Reins Supreme (2037 to 2049)

> Backlash of the AI wars results in an irrational fear of machine
> technology. A grassroots revolt to promote genetic engineering and
> it’s products push aside the last vestiges of resistance to widespread
> biotechnological use.
>
> Stereotypes against machines leads to the disfavour of blatant
> cybernetic enhancements. Instead biotech modifications become popular
> and its all the rage for new parents to try and select traits for
> their children before conception. With the development of the Proteus
> Nanovirus many people are modifying themselves in the comfort of their
> own homes!
>
> Terra-forming Micro-organisms are created to speed up the conversion
> of Mars into an Earth type habitat. They supplement the colonies of
> nano-probes that are already at work on the planet. The Novum
> colonists complain that the new micro-organisms are causing them
> discomfort, but their complaints are largely ignored.
>
> With the development of the Space Expressways, the cost of space
> travel is greatly decreased, resulting in hundreds of habitats being
> constructed and colonized throughout the solar system.
>
> Utilizing the latest in technologies Venus targeted as the latest
> candidate for terra-forming.
>
> Construction on a deep space exploration and colonization vessel is
> begun. This bold undertaking will be the single largest venture in the
> history of Mankind. The ship is immense over 800 meters long and 350
> meters wide. It will be capable of transporting over 500,000 explorers
> in cryogenic stasis and it has the capability to travel (albeit slowly
> in the grand scheme of things) to other star systems. It will be able
> to reach the nearest star system (Alpha Centauri) in just 6 years.
> It’s name is UESS Intrepid and it is the pride of the UEG.

### The Novum War (2050 to 2051)

> Tired of being given second class status by beings they consider
> inferior the Novum of Mars rise up in rebellion. All attempts at
> peaceful settlement are met with violence. In one attack that is
> considered dishonourable by most, the Novum under a flag of truce
> launch an orbital attack on the planet Earth during peace
> negotiations. Causing massive destruction and the death of millions.
>
> Outraged, the Humans spare no measure to stop the Novum in their
> increasingly violent rampage across the Solar system.
>
> Realizing that their delusions of grandeur where just that, delusions,
> the Novum attempt to salvage their dream by hijacking the almost fully
> complete Intrepid. Detonating a massive antimatter bomb beneath the
> face of the Moon to cover their escape, the Novum make off with the
> ship and arrive at Mars to evacuate their population. In their wake
> they sabotage the Space Expressway.
>
> The Antimatter blast ripped chunks of the Moon free and flung them
> towards Earth, this resulted in wide spread destruction of the massed
> fleet of the United Earth Space Navy. It also caused the destruction
> of most of the orbital space stations and devastated the surface of
> the Earth.
>
> The resulting orbital debris cloud will be a legacy of this dark day
> for decades to come, and results in the people of the Earth living in
> constant fear of destruction from above. The beleaguered resources of
> Earth are insufficient to the task of completely defending itself from
> this constant onslaught.
>
> By the time this disaster is contained the Novum are already on their
> way out of the system into the depths of space. The remnants of the
> once great space fleet complete the conquest of Mars, killing off the
> last few Novum that refused to flee.

### Rise of the Solar Confederation (2052 to 2053)

> In the aftermath of the Neo-Sapien war and due to pressures from the
> peoples of the space colonies the UEG gives up much of it’s power in
> favour of the formation of Solar System spanning unified government
> with equal representation.
>
> Realizing that humankind is still not mature enough to bear the weight
> of responsibility necessary for the creation of sentient life, the
> newly formed Solar Confederation declares all experiments into
> creating sub-races to be illegal.
>
> However these lessons are learned far to late to prevent the disaster
> that has befallen Earth. Ruined, and it’s resources nearly exhausted,
> people look to the sky in the hopes of a better life. The advent of
> contragravity technology near the end of the war makes it very
> inexpensive for pilgrimages off-world. With the Space Expressways
> being repaired heavy migrations to Mars begin.

### The Spaceways (2054 to 2065)

> Massive effort is put into establishing a network of Space Expressways
> across the entire Solar System. Combining electromagnetic and
> gravity-manipulation technology these improved Xpressways, as they are
> dubbed, accelerate and decelerate vessels between junction points,
> allowing for fast and inexpensive transit to all major destinations in
> the Solar System.

### Building Spree (2066 to 2076)

> With the lack of progress of any faster-than-light drive system the
> Solar Confederation realizes that it must get aggressive on population
> control or undertake more ventures to construct space colonies and
> terra-form worlds if it hopes to keep up with predicted population
> growth.
>
> The Confederation chooses to pursue all of these options. It
> institutes a policy that only allows “replacement” reproduction going
> forward, in other words each person is only allowed one child as their
> “replacement”. So a couple would only be allowed to have two children,
> and a single parent only one. This policy is accepted grudgingly on
> Earth, but is a source of bitter contention on the newly terra-formed
> worlds of Mars and Venus.
>
> Construction of colonies across all planets in the system is also
> begun. Massive gravity generation systems are also installed deep in
> Mercury, Mars, and Venus to make them more comfortable to live on.
>
> A few new privately funded colonization missions are launched to
> nearby star systems, but given the lack of FTL drives any such
> enterprise will take many years to complete. The government shows no
> desire to mount any, probably realizing that with the vast distances
> involved they would never be able to maintain them as non-independent
> entities. Decades later when contact is lost with the colony ships
> (some of which had heavily armed escorts) many decide that it is best
> to ignore the dark realm outside our own system.

### The Great Enterprise (2077 to 2098)

> The birth control restrictions have become a source of constant
> demonstrations, protests and even acts of minor terrorism against the
> Solar Confederation. Due to the pressure the restrictions are slightly
> relaxed, creating a lottery to allow individuals or couples to apply
> for allowances to have another child. This takes some of the heat off,
> but the government realizes it is only a matter of time before the
> issue comes up again.
>
> A bold plan is conceived to turn Jupiter’s four largest moons (Io,
> Europe, Ganymede, and Callisto) into terra-formed worlds. The rest of
> the moons of Jupiter are disassembled and their mass added to those
> remaining. Massive amounts of material from the Asteroid Belt and
> wandering comets are also used to create these new worlds. Most
> ambitious of all, the former moons are moved into the same orbit
> forming a Rosette (see GURPS Space, page 114). To compensate for their
> lack of density gravity generation systems are installed in the
> planets cores.
>
> Similar gravity systems had been installed in Mercury, Venus and Mars,
> allowing them all to have gravity almost the same as Earth. This
> allowed full terra-forming to be done to Mercury, since it now had
> sufficient gravity to hold onto an atmosphere.
>
> As a result of the massive construction of the past three decades the
> Solar Confederation is up to it’s neck in debt to the MegaCorps, which
> are growing restless wondering when they will ever see any profit from
> their investments.
>
> The final surprise is yet to come though, the Rosette formation should
> be a wonder beyond all others, but the Confederation has had a show
> topper up its sleeve for quite some time. Many questioned why the
> newly formed worlds were moved so far out from the gas giant, when
> keeping them close would have actually provided them with some of the
> heat given off by Jupiter.
>
> The reason is revealed when the Confederation government ignites
> Jupiter! Forming a new star inside the Solar System and breathing life
> into the Rosette worlds. Many corporations are stunned, since Jupiter
> in it’s normal state represented a rich source of raw materials and
> was a big part of their profitable operation. Other groups wonder at
> the long term effects of having two stars in a system that has only
> had one. The government ignores all converns, blinded by it’s own
> supposed might.
>
> While the operation was a success the results were not what the Solar
> Confederation had hoped. The general population feels that the
> government has become callous and distant, taking upon itself
> decisions that should have been decided more democratically. The
> MegaCorps are outraged at what they feel is a betrayal of their trust
> as many of their most profitable operations are destroyed by the
> culmination of the Confederations great project.
>
> When the MegaCorps demand their loans be paid immediately and
> additional compensation given for the future loss of earnings they
> will experience the government arrogantly refuses. The MegaCorps band
> together and use their private security forces to overthrow the Solar
> Confederation. There is not much protest given by the people of the
> Solar system and since the military had never been restored after the
> last war there was little contest. The Solar Confederation went out
> with a whimper rather than a bang.

### The MegaCorp Wars (2099 to 2108)

> In the wake of the coup there is dissention amongst the various Mega
> Corps about how the Solar System should now be ruled. With callous
> disregard to the health of the planets, or the people upon them, they
> wage vicious war with each other.
>
> Millions of innocents are killed in the indiscriminate destruction
> meted out by the Corps in their battles with each other. Violence is
> not limited to the battlefield as assassination sees wide spread use,
> with dead bodies popping up in alleys and sewers all over.
>
> The final indiscretion is when one MegaCorp accidentally unleashes a
> potent virus weapon it had been working on. It’s victims are turned

## Technology

The GURPS Space: The Transient Frontier campaign universe tries to be
true to a semi-Hard Science style of technology, but it is combined with
the Nanotech Revolution resulting in the rapid progression of TLs
leading up to TL13 (these alternative technology modifications are
described in detail on pages 6 and 7 of GURPS Ultra-Tech 2).

Because of the earlier maturation of Nanotechnology the pace of
technological breakthroughs is very rapidly for the six decades
following 2010, having reached TL13 sometime in the mid 2060’s things
have now slowed down to the normal progression. Below is a breakdown of
when approximate changeovers occurred for TLs:

| TL   | Year |
|------|------|
| TL8  | 2005 |
| TL9  | 2025 |
| TL10 | 2031 |
| TL11 | 2043 |
| TL12 | 2052 |
| TL13 | 2063 |

The change from one TL to another was usually signified by a hallmark
technology of that tech level (i.e. Fusion reactors for TL9,
Contragravity for TL12, etc).

Since the Hard Science pathway has been somewhat adhered to many devices
were not developed until much later, if at all. Others function
differently than is normal.

With the fall of the Solar Confederation and the widespread destruction
of the MegaCorp Wars some technology has been lost, so while the general
TL is 13 some devices that would have previously been known are now
lost, putting the actual progress level back to late TL12 or early TL13
in most areas.

### Beam Weapons

> There were a number of severe technological hurdles in the development
> of hand-held, high-energy weapons that could not be crossed until very
> recently. Even so limitations of the power cell technology (see the
> power cell section farther on) has prevented them from functioning in
> the normal fashion. All high energy weapons cannot be powered by power
> cells, they must use power cartridges (GURPS Ultra-Tech, page 60) or
> be directly powered from a reactor or similar.
>
> **Chemical-Lasers** (see Ultra-Tech 2, page 56) appear at TL8, this is
> the only type available at this time. Initially they are fragile
> (Ultra-Tech 2, sidebar page 13) and require Chemical Tanks (Ultra-Tech
> 2, page 56) to power them.
>
> Because the energy released by the chemicals is not constant these
> weapons actually use the Pulse Laser Autofire rules as discussed under
> the Modified Laser Autofire section in Ultra-Tech 2, page 56.
>
> At TL9 they are no longer fragile and use Chemical Power Cartridges
> (Ultra-Tech 2, page 56) instead of tanks, they also begin to improve
> normally for beam weapons from this point on.
>
> **Chemical-Laser variants of the Dinosaur, Survival and Gatling**
> lasers appear at TL9, but have the same limitations as the above when
> they first came out.
>
> **The Chemical Holdout Laser** appears at TL10, unlike the above types
> of lasers though it is only considered fragile at this TL, it does not
> require a tank to power it. At TL11 it is no longer fragile and it
> begins improving normally.
>
> **The Chemical Laser Crystal** does not appear until TL11, at which
> point it is fragile, but does not require a tank to power it. At TL12
> it is no longer fragile and it begins improving normally.
>
> **Lasers** (the regular kind that normally appear at TL8) do not
> appear until TL10 (two TLs later), at this time they are considered
> fragile. Since hand held weapons need to use power cartridges normal
> laser autofire rules do not apply, instead use the pulse laser rules
> as discussed above. This results from the fact that the energy flow
> provided by the power cartridges are in bursts and not continuous. At
> TL11 Lasers are no longer fragile and normal improvements apply.
>
> **Dinosaur, Survival, Holdout and Gatling Lasers** do not appear until
> TL11 (two TL’s later than normal), and at this point they are
> considered fragile. They have the same modifications to autofire as
> described above, for the same reasons. At TL12 these weapons are no
> longer fragile and normal TL improvements apply.
>
> **The Laser Crystal** appears at TL12 (two TL’s later), however it is
> fragile at this point. At TL13 they are no longer fragile and it begin
> to improve normally.
>
> **Charged and Neutral Particle Beams** suitable for mounting on
> vehicles do not appear until TL11 (3 TLs later than normal), at this
> time they are considered fragile. At TL12 they are no longer fragile
> and they start improving normally.
>
> **Flamers and Blasters** appear at TL12 (3 TL’s later than normal),
> but are fragile; plasma and tight-beam blaster variants (see
> Ultra-Tech 2, page 58) are also developed. At TL13 they are no longer
> fragile and improve as normal.
>
> **The Holdout Blaster and Omniblaster** appear at TL13 (3 TL’s later
> than normal) and are considered fragile. At TL14 they lose this
> disadvantage and begin improving as per normal. Also Omniblasters with
> the added Neural blaster setting are available, but if this option is
> included the weapon is still considered fragile, at TL15 they will no
> longer be fragile.
>
> **Space/Time Disruptors, Gamma-Ray Lasers (or Grasers) and
> Disintegrators** are relegated to TL16 devices, and as such may never
> appear in this campaign universe.
>
> **Disruptors, Scramblers and Electrolasers** appear at TL10 (1 TL
> later than normal), but as usual are considered fragile at this stage.
> At TL11 they become more mature (they are no longer fragile) and
> improve as normal.
>
> **Electron** weapons will not appear until TL14 (3 TL’s later),
> however since they are an obvious evolution of blasters they are not
> fragile when they appear and improve as normal.
>
> **Fusion Guns** will not appear until TL15 (3 TL’s later), however as
> they are just improvements on Flamers they will not be fragile at
> their introduction and will progress normally.
>
> **Nerve, Paralysis and Electromagnetic Pulse Weapons** will not appear
> until TL14 (4 TL’s later), at which point they will be considered
> fragile. At TL15 they are no longer fragile and improve normally. The
> Wiper, Hypnagogic projector and Mindrippers are however relegated to
> TL16 and as such may never appear.
>
> **Stunners and Screamers** have just become available at TL13 (4 TL’s
> later than normal), however they are considered fragile. At TL14 they
> will no longer be fragile and will improve normally.
>
> **X-Ray lasers** will become available at TL14 (4 TL’s late), they
> will not be fragile when they are first introduced though and will
> progress normally.
>
> **Pulsars, Force, Antiparticle and Gravity Beams** are all delayed 3
> TLs and thus will not start appearing until TL15, however they are not
> considered fragile when they appear and improve normally.
>
> **Big Beam Weapons** (such as those mentioned in GURPS Space
> ship-design rules, or any 10,000+ kilojoule weapon built with GURPS
> Vehicles) appear one TL earlier than the exceptions listed above, and
> are not fragile when they appear (nor do they require chemical tanks
> if they are chemical-lasers). However they cannot be powered from
> power cells either, they must be powered directly or from power
> cartridges.

### Slug Throwers

> Due to the difficulties faced in developing practical beam weapons,
> slugthrowers received more attention than they normally do in GURPS.
> As such they improved much more than is the norm. Along with
> alternative ammunition (see GURPS Ultra-Tech 2) chemical slugthrowers,
> Gauss, Electromagnetic and Gyrocs are introduced one TL earlier
> starting in TL8, see below.
>
> **Heavy Gauss Weapons** like Gauss SMGs and the Gauss Battle Rifle
> appear at late TL8 instead of TL9, and the Gauss mini-needler and
> assault cannon appear at late TL9 instead of 10.
>
> **Viper Gyrocs** appear at late TL9 instead of TL10.
>
> **The Ice Gun** also appears at late TL9 instead of 10.
>
> **Smartguns** and **The Antimatter Rifle (AMR)** relegated to TL16
> since they are based on gravity technology that functions differently
> in this campaign universe.

### Sensors

> **Bioscanners** require physical contact to perform a “scan.”
>
> **Chemscanners** have only 1% of listed range.
>
> **Multiscanners** have the same limitations applied to their chem and
> bio functions.

### Medicine

> **Cloning** at accelerated “force-growth” speeds is not possible at
> this time (maybe at TL14+).
>
> **Braintaping** did not become available until late TL11 and there
> were still some side effects to be resolved with it (only
> low-resolution braintapes were possible, see GURPS Bio-Tech, page
> 117). At TL12 low-resolution copies were possible, and by TL13 full
> copies were possible. However the technology was highly regulated by
> the government when it came out, and with all the havoc the secrets of
> full braintaping were lost. In the modern day of The Transient
> Frontier only low resolution copies are possible, and since
> Copy-Protection Nano’s were generally administered by the Solar
> Confederation government to all children at birth the usage of this
> technology is very limited. For prolonging life there are much simpler
> methods: advanced genetic alteration techniques, anti-aging drugs, and
> rejuvenation being the most common.

### Faster-Than-Light (FTL) Technology

> FTL drives do not exist yet, there are rumours that just before it’s
> fall the Solar Confederation had developed a working prototype of an
> FTL drive, but if this is true its secret was lost in the Mega-Corp
> Wars.
>
> Research into Hyperspace technology did result in other ways to
> harness this alternate dimension however, one of these is the Power
> Tap.

### Force-manipulating Technology

> **Force-field** technology, including force shields, force screens,
> and force swords do not appear until 2 TLs later than normal (i.e.
> vehicle mounted force screens do not become available until TL13,
> portable versions until TL15). However variable force screens become
> available at the same time as regular ones.
>
> *Force Screens* function differently than is normal, apply the
> following modifications: fragile and velocity-limited (Multiply DR
> provided by 1.8; see GURPS Ultra-Tech 2, page 75).
>
> *Force Swords* were developed, but in the chaos of the MegaCorp Wars
> the secret of their construction was lost, only a few examples remain
> and those will be nearly impossible to fix if they are badly damaged.
>
> **Deflectors, wards, and life-support fields** are the exception to
> this, they appear at the TL’s they usually do and function as normal.
>
> **Reactionless thrusters** are introduced at their normal TL, however
> they have an imposed minimum thrust size for each unit depending on
> the tech level, see chart below. In addition the Mega thrusters are
> mostly restricted to military class vessels.

**Minimum Thrust**:

| TL  | *Standard*     | *Super*       | *Mega*        |
|-----|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| 9   | 5,000,000 lbs  | N/A           | N/A           |
| 10  | 500,000 lbs    | 2,000,000 lbs | N/A           |
| 11  | 50,000 lbs     | 200,000 lbs   | N/A           |
| 12  | 5,000 lbs      | 20,000 lbs    | N/A           |
| 13  | 500 lbs        | 2,000 lbs     | 2,000,000 lbs |
| 14  | 50 lbs         | 200 lbs       | 200,000 lbs   |
| 15  | none           | 20 lbs        | 20,000 lbs    |
| 16  | none           | none          | none          |

> **Artificial Gravity** generators were introduced in 2031 (their
> normal TL10 introduction) and they utilized artificial singularity’s
> to produce their effect. They improve normally.
>
> **Grav Compensators** become available in 2052 (TL12) and improve
> normally.
>
> **Contragravity** technology exists, however due to changes in the way
> it functions it is not practical for man portable devices (such as
> belts). At it’s introduction in 2052 (TL12) the smallest version
> available could screen 80,000 pounds, in 2063 (TL13) breakthroughs
> were made to halve this minimum size, and for every additional TL
> halve it again. At TL16 the restriction is relaxed entirely, see the
> chart below:

| TL  | Minimum Lift |
|-----|--------------|
| 12  | 80,000 lbs.  |
| 13  | 40,000 lbs.  |
| 14  | 20,000 lbs.  |
| 15  | 10,000 lbs.  |
| 16  | none         |

> **Tractor/Pressor Beams** are delayed by 3 TLs and as such do not
> start appearing until TL14.
>
> **Nuclear Dampers** become available at TL13 instead of TL15, and
> improve normally.
>
> **Reality Stabilizers** become available at TL14 instead of TL16 and
> improve normally from there.

### Power

#### Power Cells

> Power cells store the same energy as normal, but they cannot release
> it quickly enough to be useful for beam weapons, use power cartridges
> (Ultra-Tech 2, page 60) instead.
>
> For large vehicle mounted beam weapons power can either be drawn
> directly from reactors and other continuous power sources or from
> magazines of power cartridges. If the later then use a bank of
> non-rechargeable energy cells to construct it, they will only be
> usable by identical weapons. Take the number of rounds you want to
> store, and multiply by the power requirements for a single shot of the
> weapon in question.
>
> All laser weapons run by power cartridges instead of continuous energy
> sources become Pulse Lasers and do not use the regular laser autofire
> rules, instead they use the Modified Laser Autofire rules on page 56
> of GURPS Ultra-Tech 2.

#### Power Tap (TL13)

> A power tap is essentially a Cosmic Power Plant as described on page
> 85 of GURPS Vehicles, second edition. It opens a small conduit into
> hyperspace and draws directly upon the higher energy state of that
> realm. The power tap becomes available at TL 13 and has the following
> differences from the cosmic power plant:

1. The power tap will undergo a catastrophic overload in the event of
    > damage sustained just like an Antimatter reactor (as described on
    > sidebar of page 186 in GURPS Vehicles, second edition; assume
    > useful life is 1 year for the purpose of calculating explosive
    > damage). The system can be rigged to self-destruct giving the same
    > results. A nuclear damper will not prevent the overload from
    > happening.

<!-- -->

1. The minimum size a power tap is available in is ten (10) million kW
    > at TL13, five (5) million kW at TL14, one (1) million kW at TL15,
    > and no restriction at TL16.

### Biotech

> Before the rebellion of the Novum bio-technology was enjoying the
> spotlight, since with the AI Wars there had been a slump in public
> sentiment towards conventional technology.
>
> Even after the Neo-Sapien War biotechnology continued to be an
> integral part of human society, however blatant modifications and the
> creation of para-humans was now considered to be taboo.
>
> Since 2004 genetic engineering of children at conception has been
> standard practise for the majority of parents who are able. After 2025
> it became possible for virtually every parent to have basic
> modifications done to their children. The government encouraged the
> use of genetic engineering to prevent or reduce hereditary diseases
> and other mental or physical defects.
>
> Starting in 2025 it was considered very popular for parents to
> engineer their children with the longevity advantage, ensuring that
> their children would have long productive lives.
>
> After 2031 other alternatives for prolonging human life became
> available, it was very popular for a time to give children extended
> life spans (see the extended lifespan advantage, Compedium I, page
> 54). This resulted in children who matured much slower and lived much
> longer, however certain facts of life made most realize that this
> route was not desirable. This resulted in a much more practical
> modification for extending life, the Sylvan Treatment (see below).
>
> With the invention of anti-aging drugs and treatments, as well as
> rejuvenation and cryogenic suspension it is possible to live for
> centuries. To little time has passed since the invention of these
> techniques for this dream to be fully realized, though most people can
> now expect to enjoy youth and full health for well over a century even
> without extra treatment or modification.
>
> Bio-Tech modifications can be found in GURPS Bio-Tech, Ultra-Tech, and
> Ultra-Tech 2. In addition some other modifications are found below:

#### The Sylvan Treatment (TL10)

> This modification extends the healthy life of the individual and
> delays aging until the very end of their life. The life expectancy of
> people with this enhancement is three times the value for middle age.
> For example, at TL10+ this is 110 years of age, so someone with this
> modification would live for three times that, or 330 years! At the end
> of which his body would rapidly breakdown, aging to death in a matter
> of months.
>
> This modification was seen to be desirable since the person would life
> longer than the average human and in a state of perpetual youth, thus
> allowing maximum enjoyment of their life.
>
> **Statistics:** Level 2 Extended Lifespan, level 2 Early Maturation,
> and Self-Destruct. *0 points.*

#### The Highlander Condition (TL12)

> The next obvious step to eternal life was to make it so the person
> does not age at all, and is in fact hard to kill by most normal means.
> That was what the designers of this modification were after, and they
> succeeded, after a fashion.
>
> People undergoing this modification will never grow old once they
> reach maturity, they heal very fast, are immune to most diseases and
> their bodies are very durable, able to last the long centuries.
> However the modification has a few unexpected side-effects. The
> designers decided that since the person could live for millennia it
> would be good to enhance the recall of memories, however this did not
> work out as they had planned, instead the subject suffers from minor
> flashbacks.
>
> In addition because of the drastic changes to the person’s DNA they
> are no longer able to procreate with regular humans (or ones modified
> in different ways), there is a very slim chance they can procreate
> with others with their exact modification, but it is still rather
> unlikely.
>
> Due to the very nature of the change the person’s outlook on life
> changes subtly, resulting in their being more careful and forward
> thinking (resulting in the careful and attentive disadvantages).
>
> Due to this mix of advantages and disadvantages some technician
> nicknamed the procedure after some old fictional character who had
> similar traits, and the name stuck when it went to mass market.
>
> **Statistics:** Unaging, Regular Regeneration, Immunity to Disease,
> Hard to Kill (4 levels), Sterile, Minor Flashbacks, Attentive and
> Careful. *60 points.* **Availability:** $750,000 (and 15 days). **LC**
> 6.

### Cybernetics

#### Neural Interfaces

> Nearly all children are given neural interface implants at an early
> age, because of the wide spread use of these devices it is common to
> see vehicles and weapons that do not have more than just primitive
> diagnostic readouts on them. All other functions are controlled
> through neural interfaces, as a result those characters that have the
> cyber-rejection disadvantage are often put in a bind.
>
> There is some help for this though, as neural interface helmets exist,
> however they are bulky and take time to properly attach. Not only that
> but they only give the user half the regular bonuses of a regular
> neural interface.

### Nano-Tech

### Computers

### The Space Expressways

## Culture

The fall of the Solar Confederation and the extension of the Spaceways
has revived the spirit of the pioneers. Humans can be found everywhere
in solar system, even in the most unexpected places. Habitats in the ice
plains of Pluto, floating cities in the crushing layers of Saturn’s
atmosphere, and even close orbit space stations around the Sun.

With the fragmentation of centralized government each nation and
city-state is a law unto itself for the area that it claims. There are
often disputes over exactly who does have the rights to certain
territory, or battles over slights and insults. The rule of the gun is
very much present in The Transient Frontier.

### Common Laws

> This is not to say that there are not some common laws amongst the
> colonies and cities of Man. Due to past events and hard lessons
> learned there are some things that the majority of the people believe
> in:
>
> Man should not meddle in the creation of new consciousness (AI or
> racial genetic engineering). Computers are not allowed to be built
> with artificial intelligence, in fact all computers are built to avoid
> this. Major genetic alteration of any species with the goal of
> creating a distinct or sub species with conscious intelligence is also
> strictly forbidden.
>
> No corporation should be allowed to rule the people, or control
> resources and technology to the extent whereby they influence the
> people to an undue extent.
>
> Biological warfare and terrorism are not to be tolerated. Anyone found
> to be engaging in these activities is subject to massive reprisals.
>
> The Spaceways are vital to the survival of colonists, outlaws and
> pirates alike. If any damage or subvert them they bring down the wrath
> of all parties.
>
> Due to the residual fear inspired by the AI and Neo-Sapien wars people
> flaunting obvious excesses in either genetic engineering or
> cybernetics are subject to mistrust, discrimination, persecution and
> possibly even execution.

### Control Rating and Legality

> Most travellers have one pressing concern whenever they reach a new
> colony or area of a planet, “what is legal here?”
>
> For the unclaimed regions of space a control rating (CR; see sidebar
> of GURPS Cyberpunk, page 110 or GURPS Space page 54 for more
> information) of 1 exists, meaning that all but military grade weapons
> may be carried without registration. However onboard ships themselves
> a much higher control rating usually exists and even the crew is
> hesitant about using heavy weapons for fear of damaging the ship.
>
> Most space ports are generally considered to be CR 2, while dense
> population centers range from 3 to 5. Almost no areas are CR 6 (Total
> Control) since no one would really want to live in such a place with
> thousands of alternatives within reach.

## Character Creation

### Overview

> The modern era of The Transient Frontier campaign world has just come
> out of an age very much like that described in Cyberpunk type
> campaigns (although more advanced than the norm). As such the world
> still has holdovers from that period, remnants of MegaCorps, private
> armies, netrunners, splicers, and thieves.
>
> It has however pushed through that dark time and there is light to be
> seen in the future, it is a brave new world, albeit one still
> partially under the shadow of the horrors of the old one.

### People of The Transient Frontier

> Due to the extensive use of genetic engineering and cybernetic
> implants most humans are smarter, stronger, faster and generally all
> round healthier. Many of the modern generation have been given
> advantages by their parents at birth through the use of genetic
> engineering. Others received “improvements” later in life (both
> genetic and cybernetic), and during the time of the MegaCorps this
> came very much in handy. It was a kill or be killed world at that
> time, as a result a form of natural selection took place, leaving the
> majority of people alive today with gifts above the human norm.
>
> As a result the beginning point levels are drastically altered from
> the norm, instead of the table in GURPS Basic Set (sidebar, page 11)
> use the following instead:

| Below-average     | 45 points or less  |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| Average           | 75 points          |
| Above Average     | 150 points         |
| Experienced       | 225 points         |
| Hero Material     | 300 points         |
| Full-fledged hero | 450 points         |
| Truly outstanding | 600 points         |
| Superhuman        | 900 points or more |

> There are a couple of restrictions on how the points should be spent,
> as outlined below:

1. At least 60% of starting points should be put aside to attributes
    > and/or advantages that can be considered enhancements (i.e.
    > conferred by genetics, nanotech, or cybernetics). Examples of
    > genetic enhancements are enhanced attributes, advantages such as
    > Immunity to Disease, improved physical appearance, less sleep,
    > high pain threshold, etc. Common Biomods are described in chapter
    > 3 of GURPS Bio-Tech, starting on page 61. Nanotech improvements
    > that are popular can be found on page 84 of GURPS Bio-Tech and
    > page 92 of GURPS Ultra-Tech 2. The cyberbrain modification and
    > hypertough skeleton are also examples of nanotech modifications.
    > Implants can be found in GURPS Ultra-Tech, Cyberpunk, Ultra-Tech 2
    > and other books. Unlike full cybernetics, most implants are subtle
    > by nature, those that are not will likely see the characters
    > discriminated against. Common implants are communicators,
    > computers, cyberliver, intestinal recycler, and others.

2. Obvious displays of unnatural cybernetics (glowing eyes, a silver
    > arm, etc.) or bio-tech modifications (scales, fur, unnatural eyes,
    > etc) will automatically get you a -15 point Social Stigma
    > disadvantage. Full or total cyborgs with natural appearances will
    > have a -20 point Secret, and if it gets out you will face
    > imprisonment or exile. Characters with subtle but extensive
    > genetic alterations (those that would actually classify as a
    > racial change) face a similar fate, and so have the same type of
    > Secret for a disadvantage.

3. It is possible that a few AI’s disguised in Android bodies have
    > remained amongst humankind, it is also possible that some Novum
    > have done something similar by surgically altering their
    > appearance. If this is true and a player wishes to play one of
    > these as a character they have a -30 point Secret, possible death,
    > as a disadvantage.

> Most major diseases, ailments, and genetic disorders have been cured,
> even old age. However there is the possibility that the character was
> missed in the inoculations, genetic alterations at conception, or
> could not afford the treatments later in life. Thus there is no limit
> on the disadvantages that may be taken, just remember that subtle
> social stigma may be experienced as a result of having disadvantages
> that are no longer considered common.
>
> Since most disadvantages (even mental ones) can be cured relatively
> easily a character is still restricted to the regular disadvantage
> limit of 40 points or any one large disadvantage. The standard 5
> points of quirks are also still in effect.

### Character Types

> See GURPS Space, pages 31 and 32 for a good listing of common
> character types. Note that since Psionics do not exist there are no
> Esper type characters.
>
> GURPS Cyberpunk also includes a number of character types that are
> found in The Transient Frontier, these are: Bodyguard, Broker,
> Celebrity, Cop, Corporate, Mercenary, Mobster, Netrunner, Splicer, and
> Thief.
>
> Due to the advancement of Bio-Technology the character types from

## The Solar System

### General Facts

> The primary measure of distance in the Solar System is the AU or
> Astronomical Unit, it represents the distance from the Earth to the
> Sun (Sol), approximately 93 million miles. The orbital radius and
> other statistics of the various planets of the the Solar System are as
> follows:

| Planet                | AU    | Obliquity | Rotation Period (hrs) |
|-----------------------|-------|-----------|-----------------------|
| Mercury               | 0.39  | 0.1°      | 1407.5                |
| Venus                 | 0.72  | 177.4°    | 5832.5                |

>
> The Solar system is broken up into two categories. The Inner System,
> comprised of the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.
>
> And the Outer System, consisting of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune
> and Pluto.
>
> What remains of the Asteroid Belt lies between the inner and outer
> parts of the system, acting as an arbitrary boundary.
>
> Below is a listing for each planet and major object in the Solar
> System and a brief description, for more complete details see the
> specific pages for each.

### The Sun

> Called Sol, it is the heart of our system. It is a G2 V class star
> (fairly bright, yellow, main-sequence star) with nine known
> satellites. It’s biozone (the area where a planet of the star can have
> liquid water) is between 0.8 and 1.2 AU.
>
> Type: G2 V
>
> Diameter: 863706
>
> Mass: 1.989e+30 kg
>
> Density: 1.41
>
> Biozone: 0.8 to 1.2
>
> The Sun is the largest and most prominent feature in our solar system,
> accounting for approximately 98% of the systems mass.
>
> More information on it can be found on the [Solar Views](http://www.solarviews.com/)
> page devoted to [the Sun](http://www.solarviews.com/eng/sun.htm).
>
> In The Transient Frontier you find human habitations in the strangest
> of places, while it is not actually possible to live on the Sun, the
> next best thing has been done. There is a space station in close orbit
> around the Sun that is dedicated to detailed research of our system’s
> primary.
>
> The space station Thermae varies it’s orbit around the sun for brief
> periods of study, most of the time though it orbits at 0.1 AU, which
> is four times closer to the Sun that Mercury.

#### Thermae

> Type: Space Station, research
>
> Population: Fluctuates, usually between 90 and 140
>
> Government: Technocracy
>
> Control Rating: Controlled (4)
>
> Tech Level: 13
>
> Points of Interest: The “shield ships” and excursions close to
> the Sun.
>
> Economy: Funded by research grants and corporate investments.
>
> Thermae does not get many visitors other than those going there to
> study the sun or transporting people there and back who are. The
> station is essentially fully automated, and is armoured extremely
> heavily. In addition it has the solar systems most powerful force
> field generator and cooling units.
>
> It’s standard compliment is 20 to 30 scientists and the same amount of
> technicians and assistants, plus their families.
>
> Special “shield ships” are necessary to approach the station under
> normal circumstances. These huge vessels are giant armoured,
> umbrella-like creations that serve to shield visiting craft from the
> intense heat and radiation that are present this close to the Sun.
> There are only two of these vessels, *The Hades* and *The
> Incandescent*.

### Mercury

> Mercury is the closest to the Sun and the eighth largest, it’s
> temperature variations used to be the most extreme in the system: 90 K
> to 700 K. Now it is a tropical planet with a booming tourist industry.
>
> Type: Rockball terrestrial
>
> Diameter: 3031.92 miles
>
> Gravity: 0.92G’s (0.28G’s naturally)
>
> Density: 5.42
>
> Atmosphere: Standard Earth-Norm
>
> Climate: Tropical
>
> The closest planet to our sun, it had very drastic temperature
> variations before massive terra forming was performed. For more
> information about how it used to be see the [Solar Views](http://www.solarviews.com/)
> page on [Mercury](http://www.solarviews.com/eng/mercury.htm).
>
> In The Transient Frontier, Mercury is a thriving mining planet,
> although it’s diameter is 40% smaller than Earth’s it’s density is
> almost the same. This makes it a rich deposit for heavy metals and
> other valuable minerals.
>
> All of the old colonies were located below ground for protection from
> the intense temperature shifts, and being mining colonies anyway it
> was convenient, since they were there to dig holes in the ground
> anyway. Since completion of full terra-forming though the surface is
> now fully habitable though it is still hot when compared to Earth. The
> average location on Mercury has a climate similar to that of Africa in
> the middle of July.
>
> The gravity on Mercury as only 0.28G’s (or 28% of Earth norm) before
> massive gravity generation systems were installed deep within the
> planet. Now the gravity is 0.92G’s, very close to the strength on
> Earth.
>
> The atmosphere used to be very thin and composed mostly of helium and
> sodium so it was in no way hospitable to an unprotected being. With
> the increased gravity though the ability to alter Mercury’s atmosphere
> to something close to Earth’s was achievable. It has slightly less
> oxygen than Earth’s atmosphere but other than that is completely
> breathable. It’s upper atmosphere contains a special layer designed to
> reflect most of the Sun’s heat, this is what allows the planet to
> contain Earth-like life so close to the Sun.
>
> There are only seven nations on Mercury, roughly corresponding to the
> seven original mining colonies. In addition there is a very large
> space station/shipyard in orbit around the planet which is self
> governing.

#### Thrimero

> Capital City: Thrimero City
>
> Points of Interest: The Robodome, where old mining machines
> fight it out in the blistering heat.
>
> Economy: Mining and ore-processing
>
> Thrimero was not the first mining colony established on Mercury, but
> it was the largest and most successful. Mostly the community centers
> around mining and the profits gained from it, but there is a major
> venue that has sprung up in the last few years. When old mining robots
> are considered to be obsolete they are not scrapped, at least not
> immediately, instead they are sent to the Robodome. Here they battle
> it out, with televised coverage, in a ring during the full heat of the
> Mercury day. Since Thrimero is located mostly in the equatorial areas
> of the planet it can get hot enough to melt some electronic
> components.
>
> A lot of the cities and towns in Thrimero are still mostly constructed
> underground in the old style, this provides protection from the heat
> of the day since they are in one of the hottest zones on the planet.
>
> Other major cities in the nation of Thrimero are: Ospraspak, Ynypse,
> Akado, Aldon, and Splexey.

> Economy: Mining and tourism
>
> The first mining colony ever formed on Mercury, Anstom has been
> through some rough times. Until very recently it was run by a
> corporate style government, but that was finally removed in the last
> decade.
>
> Though it does not have the most prolific mines it does boast most of
> Mercury’s culture, and almost all of the planets major tourist
> attractions. It has the dubious distinction of having the deepest, and
> least productive, mineshaft on the planet which is usually a good draw
> for tourists. Also on this tour are the Crystal Fire Caves which is
> nothing more than a large cavern formed of natural crystal that
> experiences seepage from a methane deposit. But the random and
> colourful blasts it produces are an exciting tour event. Finally there
> is the Mercurian History Museum, home to relics of the colonisation
> and artefacts of the planets short inhabited history.
>
> Once, the population was much higher but it was struck hard by the
> Berserker virus in the last war and is still recovering. The major
> cities of Anstom (other than Anstom City) are: Jikak, Lena, New
> Prague, and Sherp.

### Venus

> Venus is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, it is
> considered Earth’s sister planet by many as it is only slightly
> smaller than Earth (95% of Earth’s diameter, 80% of Earth’s mass). It
> had a super dense atmosphere approximately 90 times the pressure of
> Earth’s, composed mostly of carbon dioxide, and was hotter than
> Mercury (approximately 740K), but without the drastic variations.
> After terra-forming it is now a warm Earth-like planet that is fast
> becoming the agricultural center of the Solar system.

### Earth

> Earth, sometimes called Terra Firma, is the cradle of humanity as it
> has been called is the densest major body in the system; it has a
> single natural satellite called the Moon, as well as several immense
> orbital space colonies.

### Mars

> Mars is named after the Roman god of war, its surface temperatures
> range widely from as little as 140 K (-133 C, -207 F) at the winter
> pole to almost 300 K (27 C, 80 F) on the day side during summer. It
> has two satellites: Phobos and Deimos. Mars has a very thin atmosphere
> composed mostly of the tiny amount of remaining carbon dioxide (95.3%)
> plus nitrogen (2.7%), argon (1.6%) and traces of oxygen (0.15%) and
> water (0.03%); pressure is less than 1% of Earth norm.

### The Asteroid Belt

> Many theorize that the asteroid belt is debris from a planet that
> failed to form or was ripped apart in it’s early formation. Whatever
> it might have been it is now a collection of small planetoids, the
> largest which is called Ceres, that orbit around the Sun between Mars
> and Jupiter.

### Jupiter

> Jupiter was the fifth planet from the Sun and by far the most massive,
> weighing in at twice as much as all other planets combined! A gas
> giant composed of 90% hydrogen and 10% helium, it had 28 satellites
> the largest of which were: Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. Since
> the great world construction project performed by the Solar
> Confederation though Jupiter is much different than it once was.

### Saturn

> Saturn is sixth from the Sun and the second largest planet. It is the
> least dense of them all, its specific gravity being 0.7, which is less
> than water. It is composed of 75% hydrogen and 25% helium with other
> trace elements, it has 30 satellites, the most significant of which
> are: Titan, Rhea, Dione, and Tethys.

### Uranus

> Uranus is the third largest planet. It is actually smaller in mass
> than Neptune, its atmosphere is about 83% hydrogen, 15% helium and 2%
> methane. It has over 20 satellites, the largest being: Titania,
> Oberon, and Umbriel.

### Neptune

> Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and fourth largest by
> diameter. It has eight satellites, 7 minor ones and one major, Triton.

### Pluto

> Because Pluto‘s orbit is so eccentric, it sometimes crosses the orbit
> of Neptune, making Neptune the most distant planet from the Sun for a
> few years. It is the smallest planet, smaller even than seven of the
> solar system’s moons (the Moon, Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Titan,
> and Triton). The surface temperature on Pluto varies between about
> -235 and -210 C (38 to 63 K), it has one satellite, called Charon.

## Vehicles

Due to the rapid explosion in technology it is not uncommon to see TL11
to TL13 vehicles travelling along side each other. In fact it is very
common to see ships that have a mix of TL’s in their components.

Often there is not much wrong with an older space ship or shuttle other
than it is a little bigger and less refined than it’s newer siblings.
However practically speaking a TL11 space ship and a TL13 space ship
will get you around the solar system just as well as the other given
that most aren’t designed to go very fast anyway. The Space Expressways
are mostly used to move traffic around the solar system, if you go off
the beaten path for some reason be prepared to take a leisurely gaunt,
as most space craft are not designed for this.

Of course newer craft are lighter, more fuel efficient and generally
have superior weapons if they sport any at all. With the advent of
contragravity at TL12 there is a slight shift in ship design, since it
is now possible for very large ships to land and take off from planets
relatively easily. Specialized trans-atmosphere shuttles become rare in
favour of larger more general purpose ones.

With the introduction of force screens and the improvement of
reactionless drives at TL13 one sees another shift in starship
construction. Larger power plants now become the norm, to power these
new devices.

**Notes:** All vehicles were designed using GURPS Vehicle Designer. You
can get the design files in
[here](http://www.agamemnon.net/gurps_transient_frontier-vehicles.zip).
In order to view these files you will need to download GVD, which you
can find
[here](http://www.sjgames.com/gameaids/gurps/GVDSetup128.zip).

### Civilian Aerospace Craft

> More than 80% of all commerce, manufacturing, and mining takes place
> in space. Therefore it is not surprising that a large segment of the
> population finds it more convenient to live in space. Often it is
> cheaper to buy a 50+ year old ship that you can take with you, than a
> house or apartment on a colony. Most personal craft sport some kind of
> light armament to protect themselves from the pirates and other
> outlaws plying the space ways.

### Civilian Bulk Transports

> Bulk transports are used to haul volume freight between worlds and
> even around on the same world. They utilize modular containers to hold
> their cargo, this enables them to be easily outfitted to transport a
> variety of substances. Other pods have also been developed for the
> bulk transports to turn them into platforms for different types of
> enterprises, or just to augment freight hauling. One set of pods turns
> a bulk transport into a colony ship, another a survey ship, and
> another a troop transport. Below is an example of some types of
> containers, and some ships made to haul them.

### Military Aerospace Craft

> There is not much difference between military and police forces in the
> late 21st and early 22nd century. Most patrol craft are only lightly
> armed, while the assault craft are bristling with weapons.

### Military Missiles & Torpedoes

> Missiles in this section are mostly what would be called space cruise
> missiles, which are basically super smart self piloting kamikaze
> attach craft.

#### The Predator III

> This unmanned attack drone is the ultimate culmination of cruise
> missile technology. Capable of traversing both atmosphere and space,
> almost completely unnoticed with its impressive stealth capabilities,
> and with practically infinite range this missile is capable of
> delivering a nuclear payload anywhere given enough time.
>
> Armed with both active and passive sensors as well as a highly
> sophisticated robot intelligence that can actually learn from past
> mistakes, this drone will dog its enemy’s tail until it is destroyed
> or the target is.
>
> The state of the art reactionless drive system, antimatter reactor,
> and living metal hull are what give it the fearsome range, but the
> fact that it has a devious tactical computer that is willing to lurk
> on the fringes of it’s targets sensor range until the time is right is
> what gives this missile it’s reputation. Some people insist that the
> programmers of the missile’s guidance and attack program gave it the
> ability to toy with it’s prey before making the kill. The manufacturer
> has denied this allegation, but that has not stopped many from
> wondering after watching one in action.

#### The Decimator

### Civilian Terrestrial Vehicles

> This group of vehicles includes any kind of surface vehicle, including
> those travelling on water.

### Military Terrestrial Vehicles

> This category includes wet navy vessels such as frigates and aircraft
> carriers most of which are well into their 5th decade or more of
> service. It also includes the many new types of land weapons,
> including bipedal robot vehicles called Mecha.

### Military Terrestrial Battlesuits

> Ground based battlesuits have been a common site on the battlefield
> for almost a century now and are a stable of the mobile infantry and
> marine corps.

#### The Legionnaire Light Battlesuit

> Introduced in 2086 the Legionnaire has been manufactured by several
> different companies. It is a staple of the heavy infantry and
> planetary exploration teams alike. It provides superior protection,
> mobility, and has the systems to give a soldier a more detailed view
> of the battlefield, or an explorer better access to the data he needs
> to complete his job.
>
> The Legionnaire saw heavy use in the MegaCorp Wars, and is still a
> common sight to this day. Hundreds of thousands of the suits were
> produced, and their production continues today. Though new suits lack
> the force shield since the technology to produce it was lost in the
> Mega-Corp wars.

> reactor except for the deflector field, force screen and nuclear
> damper; thus the latter systems can only be engaged for a short
> duration (average of half an hour when all are activated).

### Military Terrestrial Mecha

> Mecha are giant bipedal vehicles that bristle with weaponry and are
> coated in layers of armour. They resemble larger, meaner versions of
> battlesuits, the main difference being their size.

#### The Monster

> Rumour has it that the designer of the Monster came up with the idea
> while watching an old 20th century animated movie. A quick search on
> the SolNet gave him the details he needed, and from there the rest is
> history. Somehow Anderson Tucker convinced a consortium of mid-sized
> companies and investors that The Monster was going to be the ultimate
> weapon on the modern day battlefield. Only 60 were ever produced
> before Tucker Robotics was shutdown due to lack of funding, but when
> the first one rolled off the line in 2064 it incorporated features
> that were ahead of it’s time.
>
> They were brought out of storage and saw heavy action in the war that
> was the last gasp of the MegaCorps, but other than that they have
> faded into the realm of myths. Most were bought up by wealthy private
> collectors, others were stolen by pirates and later destroyed in
> battle. It is rumoured that several police forces may have one hidden
> away in their arsenals, but there is little proof to support this. Of
> course just the rumour of someone having one is enough to stop most
> sane people from messing with them, you can never be to careful,
> especially in regards to machine that can smash a good sized army to a
> pulp all by itself, and from tens of miles away.
>
> Larger than many three storey buildings, The Monster has often been
> described as a vehicle of excess, it packs more firepower than should
> be needed by a ground assault vehicle. If someone wanted to cause the
> destruction it is capable of, it would be far safer to bake the site
> from orbit. However these critics entirely miss the point of the
> battle robot, it was designed to be the mobile command center of a
> frontline military ground force. It packs the sensors and
> communications to allow battlefield commanders to lead their troops
> from the thick of things, yet without sacrificing the wealth of data
> they would have at their fingertips in a normal command craft. It also
> gives them the assurance of knowing that they always have their
> artillery support and tactical strike capabilities, no matter what.
>
> The one major downside to all this firepower though is if you happen
> to be beside it when ones gets cracked open. The explosive force of
> it’s ammunition is nothing compared to the antimatter reactor going up
> with the force of a multi-megaton warhead. Luckily with a built in
> nuclear damper and plenty of reserve power the chances of such an
> occurrence should be very minuscule, at least in theory.
>
> If one thinks of what you get when you combine a mobile command post,
> heavy artillery battery, anti-aircraft/anti-armour battery, and heavy
> tank together you will in no doubt bring to mind the image of a
> Monster.
