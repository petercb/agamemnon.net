This armed and armoured speed bike is the pinnacle in light urban
assault vehicles. It is agile, fast, and wickedly armed. It also comes
with all the toys and trimmings like a 2-year nuclear power source for
no hassle driving, booster jets, computerized controls, puncture
resistant tires, and a whole lot more. An onboard computer that is
capable of running the most demanding of targeting and gunnery
programs is also included. For weapons and backup power the bike also
sports a removable E-Cell, during idle time the nuclear power source
will automatically recharge it for maximum usage (with rechargeable
cell only).
