## Hundley Arms XMP, XAC, and XSMG (Late TL7)

The X series of weapons all use the same basic weapon, with changes in barrel
length and shoulder and forestock.

The magazine is a cylinder, mounted in line with the barrel, behind the trigger.
The rounds are fed into the chamber by the turning of the core of the cylinder,
which is one large screw.

The three weapons, all using .22 LR, are a machine pistol (5" barrel), an SMG
(9" barrel) with a folding stock, and an auto carbine (18" barrel) with a fixed
shoulder stock.

Magazines come in a standard 50 round size, but a 100 round size is also
available. The 50 round costs $5 and weighs 1.5 lbs. The 100 round costs $10 and
adds 1.5 lbs to weight.

Semi automatic only versions are available for 1/2 cost. The XSMG and XAC can
use a laser and telescopic sight, while the XMP can use one or the other. For an
extra $25, the XAC can be factory modified to accept a bayonet.

**Game Stats:** All the weapons malfunction on a Crit. failure in semi auto
fire, a 16+ in auto fire. 50% of all malfunctions in autofire are jams (roll
normally for semi auto). The weapons do handle recoil well though. The XAC adds
recoil only on every other burst.

## Hundley Arms M-143b Airico Minigun (Late TL7)

The M-143b is a man portable, three barreled automatic weapon, using caseless
5.56mm ammo. The weapon is belt fed from a pack carried on the users back with a
capacity of 400 rounds, and a weight of 24 pounds, the gun itself weighs 30
pounds. The gun is designed to be fired either from the hip (with a sling), from
a bipod (included), tripod, or from a fixed mount. The gun has a removable
firing grip that can be attached either on top (for hip firing) or on the bottom
(for firing from a bipod or tripod). For use from a fixed emplacement, the
firing grip is not used; rather, a cable links the gun to the gun controls (yes,
you can be cyberlinked to this weapon without any special modifications to it).
The gun has a built-in Telescopic (2) HUD Laser Targeting System. The stats
below assume the sights are on and working. If not, then the snapshot number is
16 and the accuracy is 6 (which can only be gained by walking the burst). The
gun has two rates of fire, taking one second to change between the two. 100
rounds of ammunition costs $80, and weighs 4 pounds. The ammo pack weighs 6
pounds, costs $100 and has a PD of 2 and DR of 10.

A more portable version is also produced, it uses two cylinders attached to the
back of the gun to feed ammunition instead. Each cylinder holds 50 rounds,
weighs 2 pounds and costs $75. The weight of the gun is increased to 34 for this
version and ammo is a total of 100. The cost of the weapon is 2650, all other
stats are the same.

## Dysonian Arms M-41a pulse rifle (Late TL7)

The pulse rifle is a sub-machine gun firing 10mm caseless HE rounds. It is
equipped with a built in 30mm grenade launcher, which is used like a shotgun.
The ammo capacity is high, at 100´10mm rounds (although the digital ammo counter
doesn't go higher than 99) and 5´30mm rounds. The gun comes with a sling and
carrying handle. The sub-machine gun portion of the gun is capable of selective
fire. Various sights and vision aids can be added.

Cost (10mm magazine) $125, cost (5 x 30mm shells) $100; weight (10mm mag) 2.5
lbs, weight (5 x 30mm shells) 4 lbs.

\* — HE damage is 1d 2 (min. 1); multiply by 5 if it goes off inside a person or
living being; -2 DR for penetration purposes, at TL8+ High Explosive Armor
Piercing (HEAP) ammo is available with no modifier to DR.

## Remington SU-12k Under Rifle Shotgun Attachment (TL7)

This is a pump shotgun with a sawed off barrel and the buttstock removed. It is
fitted to a rifle in much the same way as an M 203 grenade launcher. It may only
be fitted to rifles. The rifle and shotgun may be fired the same round, but
accuracy for both is halved, and ROF of both is 1 (unless the rifle is being
fired automatic).

## Hades Corp Incinerator I-7E (Late TL7)

This is a lightweight flamethrower with a small fuel bottle, attached directly
below the gun, rather than using a large backpack. The fuelpack is PD 2 DR 4,
and it is  4 to be hit. If penetrated, it has a 50% chance of exploding
(exception: HE rounds always cause it to explode), doing 4d6 per second of fuel
left in the hex it is in, halved for every hex away from the explosion. The
recoil penalty is taken only if the firer continues firing at the same target in
consecutive rounds. Also, while a laser sight could be added to improve the snap
shot number, it won't help on accuracy (the flame obstructs view of the laser
beam). The 3d6 damage per round cannot be stopped by water or most conventional
fire extinguishers of TL7 or less. Additional ammo costs $100 and weighs 4
pounds per fuel bottle.

\* 3d per round until extinguished; ammo is measured in seconds.

## Simms AS-12/10 10mm Assault Shotgun (Late TL7)

The AS 12/10 is a fully automatic shotgun firing 10mm rounds (similar to the old
Terran .410 gauge round) of either shot or rifled slug. The weapon resembles the
old AK 47 externally. Rifle type sights are provided as is a sling and bayonet
lug. Telescopic or laser sights may be used. A loaded clip costs $10 for shot,
or $30 for rifled slug. Clips are available that alternate round type ($25).
Heavier versions (15mm) were tested, but ammo capacity was poor, and the recoil
was hideous.

\* shotgun slugs should use the same modifiers as pre 20th century rifle rounds
double the target's DR, but any damage that gets through is doubled

## Dysonian Arms Barracuda target pistol (Late TL7)

The Barracuda is a .45 calibre magnum, bolt action, magazine fed, target and
hunting pistol. The gun is rather heavy, but does not have the kick one would
expect. If the gun is dropped or abused, its accuracy drops by 1 3 points. A
shoulder stock (doubling as a holster) is available, at a cost of $150 and
adding +3 to accuracy and 2.5 pounds to weight. The Barracuda is a very
difficult handgun to conceal, as it is 16" long. Price and accuracy include
target sights. If a telescopic sight is fitted, drop the weapon's base acc by  2
(the high quality target sights can no longer be used). Ammo costs $10 per 50
rounds, and weighs 3 lbs.

## Hundley Arms Nitro Express Sniper Rifle (Early TL8)

Using the same technology as the Assault Carbine (see Ultra-Tech) the sniper
rifle is a semi-automatic high powered rifle. Like the Assault Carbine it has
twin 10-round magazines, both feeding into the same firing chamber. Each
magazine can be loaded with a different type of ammunition, usually a mix of
armor-piercing and explosive rounds. The firer can select between magazines; on
a successful skill roll this does not take an action, but must be announced
before firing. Ammo weighs 0.4 lbs per 10-round cassette. The gun comes standard
with a Telescopic (6) HUD Laser Targeting System. The gun has a skill penalty
of -1 when fired unaimed because of the bulk of the scope, but the system adds
half the Acc when fired on a snap shot. If the targeting system is broken
increase SS to 16 and decrease Acc to 13.

## Simms AG-17/20 20mm assault gun (Early TL8)

The AG 17/20 is designed for use against light vehicles and heavily armored
troops. The gun is lightweight, with manageable recoil, and fires a variety of
ammunition, including APS, Flechette, HE, and standard ammo. The weapon weighs
only 9 pounds, the 10 round clip weighs 6 pounds, with the cost varying
depending on the ammo type. A 5-round clip is available which reduces the
weapons weight by 3 pounds. A sling is provided, as well as laser and HUD sights
with a 2 Telescopic Scope. Unaimed shots are at a -1 to skill because of the
bulk of the gun and scopes. The 20mm ammo used in this gun is not
interchangeable with other 20mm ammo, as it uses a smaller powder charge to
achieve lower recoil.

## Mauser 960-A Assault System (TL8)

This is typical of a 'do it all' weapon system at TL8 9. The Mauser 960 is a
pulse laser with a built in magazine fed 40mm grenade launcher. The laser uses a
belt battery. A 6 scope comes standard with the gun. Also included with the
weapon system, packed inside the hollow butt stock, are 2 emergency flares, a
pulse signal stick, 2 packages of emergency rations, 5 meters of nylon cord, a
flashlight, and a mini first aid kit. Included, but not stored in the weapon, is
an entrenching tool. A vibro bayonet, which can actually be launched from the
gun by throwing a thumb switch, is included. The total weight of the system,
minus laser battery and grenades, is 23 pounds. With one load of ammo, weight is
30 pounds.

## Dysonian Arms SAW-7d (Early TL8)

The SAW (Squad Assault Weapon) is a combination weapon in use by the Army and
Marines. Using the standard rifle configuration, the system uses a 7.5 mm belt
fed light machine gun with a magazine fed .75 inch (19mm) gyroc launcher
underneath (see Ultra Tech). The ammo for the LMG is carried in a small pack on
the user's back, and consists of 200 rounds. The belt is protected by a flexible
rectangular hose. The weapon is intended to be hip fired.

## Simms AP-7/10 Snub Pistol (Late TL8)

This 10mm pistol uses low velocity ammo, and is intended for use on starships.
Various types of ammo are available. A cheaper, revolver version is available:
the gun is $200, ammo is $15 and 0.1 pound, and magazine capacity is 6.

## 4cm Rocket Assisted Grenades (TL8)

RAGs can either be fired from a special grenade launcher, or from a rifle with a
RAG attachment. When used from a rifle, conventional (ie, slug) ammo may be
used. The shells come in various types.The dedicated launcher has a battlefield
sight like the G 2 GBR. RAGs can be made laser guided at x10 cost, and with a
20% drop in damage. The rocket kicks in 3 yards after firing, at which time the
grenade is armed. The attachments can be made for rifles 4mm to 8mm.

## ArmsCorp G-4 Gauss Pistol (TL9)

This is a conventional looking pistol, using 4mm rounds. The gun can fire semi
auto or four round bursts. Treat armour penetration and damage as per a Gauss
SMG. The gun has adjustable micro sights. Though awkward, the G 4 can fire a RAG
(acc 3 for RAG), with a grenade attachment costing twice normal (see below).
