## TACTICAL COMPUTER

Requires an Encephalon and I/O SPU. Acute hearing and sight bonuses add to
tracking. The addition of other sensory improvements raise the effective level
of the system by 1. (Bug detector, Light intensification, Independently
Focusable Eyes, Infravision, Night Sight, Telescopic Vision, 360-Degree Vision,
Parabolic Hearing, Subsonics, Ultrasonics, Radar, Range Finder) An Orientation
System will add 2 to the tactical computers effective level. A tactical computer
can mark and track a number of targets equal to its level plus the IQ of the
user. To successfully mark a target roll against the level of the computer plus
any acute vision bonuses. Once a target has been marked add half the computers
level to any attack roll made against the target. If the user already has the
tactics and/or tracking skill add the bonus to it or take the higher skill
rating of the two.

|Level|Bonuses|Cost|
|-----|-------|----|
|1|Tracking/IQ, Tactics/IQ|$100,000 (20 points)|
|2|Tracking/IQ+1, Tactics/IQ+2|$200,000 (30 points)|
|3|Tracking/IQ+2, Tactics/IQ+4|$400,000 (40 points)|
|4|Tracking/IQ+3, Tactics/IQ+6|$800,000 (60 points)|

## ORIENTATION SYSTEM

Requires Internal Memory (amount is dependent on how much of an area the user
stores and how long he keeps it). The system can acquire maps of the area in two
ways. The first way is to buy them and upload them into memory this requires a
datalink/interface jack. The second way is to map the area yourself, to map an
area within sight roll versus your IQ (if a tactical computer is also present
add half its level). If successful that area is mapped in whatever detail your
senses are capable of. Every 8 square miles uses 1 Mp of storage space.

## RANGE FINDER

Requires a bionic eye.

**Cost:** $2000 (1 point)

## WIRED REFLEXES

Cannot be used in combination with Boosted Reflexes or a full cyborg body.

|Level|Bonuses|Cost|

|2|+4 Speed, +1 Initiative|$165,000 (30 points)|
|3|+6 Speed, +2 Initiative, +1 DX|$500,000 (60 points)|
