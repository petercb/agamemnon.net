[Palladium Books](https://www.palladiumbooks.com/) is the publisher of many fine
role playing games. They are probably most well known for the RIFTS campaign
world, which is a diverse universe which also allows you to link all the various
other games they have together.

Most of their games all share a common rules system, so its relatively easy to
move from one game to another. This is also what allows players and GMâ€™s to take
characters and such from the other games (say for example Robotech) and drop
them into the Rifts universe.

Since most of their games share a similar rule system, I made a
[customized generic character sheet](palladium-cs.pdf)
that should work for most cases.
