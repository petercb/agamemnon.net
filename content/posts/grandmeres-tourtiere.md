## Directions

Oven temp 400 F (200 C)

Combine filling ingredients in a heavy dutch oven. Bring to a boil and lower heat. Cook over medium-low, stirring until the meat loses its red colour and the liquid has reduced by about half.

Simmer about 1 hour, stirring frequently until almost all liquid is gone.

Remove from heat. When cooked, remove any fat from surface. Cool.

Line two deep pie plates with pastry.

Fill with cooled meat mixture.

Cover with top crust. Flute and seal edges. Slash top crust.

Combine a beaten egg with 2 Tbsp water and brush over crust.

Bake 30-40 minutes or until golden. Cover edges with foil if pastry browns too quickly.

Serve in wedges.

If freezing, cool the tourtieres to room temperature. Wrap well and freeze.
