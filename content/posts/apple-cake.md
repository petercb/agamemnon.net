There is an eatery in Toronto on the corner of Jarvis and Richmond streets called Mystic Muffin that serves the worlds best apple cake.

The sign says it, and I agree.

The owner Elias makes many dishes that I loved to consume when I worked in the area.

I attempted to make my own apple cake, the following is the result of research and tinkering I performed to do so.

It is a complete failure, and nothing like what I was trying to replicate. But still good enough to tide me over until I can return and buy some of the real deal.

|1/2 cup (125 mL) |granulated sugar|

2. Beat in oil, apple juice and vanilla.
3. In separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder and salt.

5. In small bowl, mix brown sugar with cinnamon.

8. Carefully spread batter over apples; smooth top.
