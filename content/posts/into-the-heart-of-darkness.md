    Death transposed to a semblance of life,
    yet incomplete in its immortal form;
    upon this world to cause misery and strife,
    passions greatly perverted from the norm.
    Preying on the helpless like a vulture,
    stalking the night shrouded in shadows cape;
    reveling in their wonderful culture,
    but feeding on these descendants of apes.
    Maintaining the masquerade youâ€™re a lie,
    dreadful beast I know you for what you are.
    Now the hunt is on, you the prey, not I.
    To late you sense the danger evil Vampyre,
    unholy creature called Nosferatu.
    Your time is up, for now I have You!
