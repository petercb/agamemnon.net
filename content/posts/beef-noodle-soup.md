So I have a new toy to play with in the kitchen, a Pressure Cooker. Ok, its not really new. I found it in the basement, my wife bought it several years ago.

Since hauling it out I've made lamb curry, 9 bean soup, and now Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup. It has been a favourite of mine for the past couple years, and it turns out its dead simple to make with the pressure cooker. I came across an excellent recipe for it [here](https://peggyunderpressure.com/beef-noodles/), and followed it mostly to the letter (we didn't have any tomatoes, so we omitted them and it still turned out well).
